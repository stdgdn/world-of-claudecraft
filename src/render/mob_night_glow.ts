// A faint warm pool of light on the ground under every nearby character after
// dark, so a mob standing in an unlit field still reads as a body rather than as
// a patch of shadow. Deliberately NOT an outline or a highlight: it is the light
// the world is missing at night, put back under the thing you need to see.
//
// One pooled InstancedMesh for the whole scene (one additive draw). The
// renderer hands `emit` its live entity views once a frame and this module owns
// the walk, so the coordinator keeps a single call rather than another loop. The
// per-frame path allocates nothing: matrices, colors, and the scratch transform
// are owned once here, and a body past the pool cap simply goes without a disc,
// which is the crowd-safe failure mode (the discs are cosmetic; nameplates,
// health bars, and the rigs themselves are untouched).
//
// This is a NIGHT VISIBILITY layer, and it is now the FALLBACK arm of that
// job: wherever the night light field runs (night_light_field.ts, every tier
// that compiles the standard splat material, which is exactly the set of
// tiers that darken at night), nearby bodies light the ground through the
// terrain shader as real light instead, and the renderer hands this layer a
// zero amount. The disc pool serves the configurations without the field
// (`?nightlights=off` today), driven purely by the frame's night amount
// (night_lighting_core.ts), which is already 0 on the tiers whose world never
// darkens. Every configuration that HAS night therefore has a body cue; which
// mechanism paints it is cosmetic, per the graphics-fairness rule. Two field
// limits worth knowing against the discs: the field lights terrain only (a
// body on a dock or bridge deck casts nothing there), and it spends
// NIGHT_LIGHT_DYNAMIC_SLOTS on the nearest bodies where the pool here holds
// MOB_GLOW_POOL discs.
