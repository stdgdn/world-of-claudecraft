// The long-buff VFX policy: a buff worn for LONG_BUFF_VFX_SECONDS or more is
// SILENT while held: no orbit band, no ground disc, no held barrier shell,
// and no sustained transformative body rim.
// Cast-moment feedback (the gain swirl, shell flash, linger) stays. Rationale:
// a 30 minute stat buff communicates nothing actionable, and a raid wearing
// five of them each is unreadable noise (the star halos / heartbeat rings /
// ground discs pile-up). The threshold is safe because the content has a
// natural gap: every buff aura is authored at <= 60s (barriers, procs,
// cooldowns, all actionable) or >= 300s (raid buffs, aspects, imbues, forms).
// Exceptions are explicit, never implicit: morph/veil styles are identity
// states (shapeshift forms, shadowform, stealth) and keep their reads, and an
// authored buff.persist opts a spec out. Pure and host-agnostic: the duration
// comes from the static ability content, so all three hosts agree by
// construction. tests/ability_vfx_longbuff_core.test.ts pins the exact
// silenced set; the painter consumes this in its aura scan.
