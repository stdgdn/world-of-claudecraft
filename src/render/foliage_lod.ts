// Distance windows for the instanced tree / rock / dressing buckets, kept apart
// from foliage.ts so the decision itself is pure: no Three, no DOM, no GFX
// singleton, unit-testable in Node (tests/foliage_lod.test.ts).
//
// TWO ARMS, TWO LAWS. On the sprite arm (GFX.standardMaterials and not
// leanFoliage) the far field belongs to baked sprite impostors of the real
// models (foliage_impostor.ts), which are legible in clear air, so the
// real-model handoff follows the BUDGET: spriteSwapDistance in
// foliage_impostor_core.ts. This module keeps the shared plumbing (the
// distance tables, the governor scales, the fog cull, bucketVisible) plus the
// LEAN arm's law below.
//
// THE LEAN ARM HAS NO IMPOSTORS AT ALL: past the tree-detail distance its
// trees simply end. That is why treeDetailDistance still follows the FOG: the
// forest may only end where fog has already blended it at least
// IMPOSTOR_MIN_FOG_BLEND of the way to solid, else the world visibly runs out
// of trees in clear air. The short-fog realms need the OPPOSITE guard: their
// budgeted radius overshoots the foliage fog cull entirely (marsh: detail
// 216-300u against a cull at 129-165u), so the boundary retreats to the fog
// floor, the deepest-in-the-murk point the blend law allows. If even the
// floor sits past the cull (very low model quality), trees run to the cull
// line and the blend law holds vacuously.

 * foliage down first under load). It may still shrink the detail radius, but
 * never past the point where fog stops hiding the swap: a transient dip while
 * assets decode and shaders compile used to drag the boundary in to ~216u and
 * park cones in plain view until the budget recovered, which read as "the trees
 * are still cones until they load".
 *
 * `fogLimit` (foliageFogLimit) caps it from the other side: a swap at or past
 * the foliage fog cull would draw real trees the cull is about to drop and
 * starve the impostor band to nothing, which is exactly what happened in every
 * short-fog realm. When the budgeted radius overshoots the cull, the swap
 * retreats to the fog floor (the nearest point the blend law allows), and the
 * band between floor and cull goes to impostors. The result always satisfies
 * detailFar <= fogLimit.
 *
 * INPUT CONTRACT: `fogNear`/`fogFar` are the ATMOSPHERIC fog, the authored
 * preset times the day-night scale, never the residency-clamped live values.
 * The streaming clamp can pin the live view at a 45u wall (and briefly leave
 * near above far while near eases after far snaps); fed those, the retreat
 * would park impostor cones a few strides from the camera for the length of
 * every streaming window. With atmospheric values the floor stays where the
 * realm's real murk is, and the min() against `fogLimit` (which IS live) is
 * what keeps the swap behind the wall meanwhile. The degenerate arm below is
 * defense in depth for a malformed preset, not the clamp transient.

 * briefly made the numeric cap measure from their near edge: that inflated
 * their kept radius by a bucket bounding radius, ~290u on the shipped
 * ~500x240u slabs, and roughly tripled the shadow pass. The right axis for that
