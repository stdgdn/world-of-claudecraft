# src/render/: Three.js renderer

Turns an `IWorld` snapshot into a frame, every frame. **Presentation only:** it
reads the world and draws it; it MUST NOT mutate sim state (`Renderer`'s ctor
takes `private sim: IWorld`). New data/action a draw path needs: extend
`IWorld` first (see src CLAUDE.md), never reach into `Sim`/`ClientWorld`.

## Module map (families + exemplars; enumerate with `ls src/render/*.ts`)
`renderer.ts` is the orchestrator: scene/camera/lights, the
`views: Map<id, EntityView>` mapping world entities to meshes, and `sync()`,
the per-frame entry called from `main.ts` (see its signature in `renderer.ts`).
Everything else is a sibling module in one of these families:
- **World subsystems** export a `build*()` returning a `*View` the renderer
  owns: `terrain.ts` (chunked LOD + PBR splat), `props.ts`/`foliage.ts`/
  `dungeon.ts` (instanced/merged GLBs), `water.ts` (terrain-aware water bodies;
  shore-depth and tier core in `water_core.ts`, sleeping GPU height field and
  facing-aligned character volume wakes in `water_simulation.ts`), `sky.ts`. Event/minigame scenes follow
  the same pattern: `jail_scene.ts`, `vale_cup_*.ts`, `yumi_*.ts`, `battleground*.ts`
  (Thornhollow Fields: kit-module field from the pure `battleground_core.ts` manifest,
  entity props in `battleground_props.ts`).
  the same pattern: `jail_scene.ts`, `vale_cup_*.ts`, `yumi_*.ts`. Rift
  portals: `door_portal.ts` also builds the bespoke world-rift gate GLB with
  its rank-tinted energy membrane (`buildRiftGateBody`), and `rift_rank.ts` is
  the floating C/B/A/S rank badge above a world rift portal.
- **Per-frame overlay/FX modules** ticked from `sync()`: `vfx.ts` (pooled
  particles), `weather.ts` (any weathered biome inside the camera box drives
  precipitation and masked spawns keep it over that zone's own cells, so a
  neighbouring realm's snow is visible from outside; decisions in
  `weather_field_core.ts`), `character_effects.ts`.
- **Cross-surface shader services** own a shared uniform block plus a GLSL
  snippet that SEVERAL materials splice, never a copy per material.
  `biome_haze_field.ts` (+ its `_core`) is the reference: one small world-space
  DataTexture of per-zone haze colour and strength (colour carries the zone's
  light level and its baked weather veil, so a twilight realm reads dim and a
  snowing one white from outside), which `terrain.ts`, the far vista tiles and
  `water.ts` all splice at the same anchor (immediately before
  `<fog_fragment>`) on the same uniform objects, so distant land carries its
  own realm's atmosphere and the detail-horizon handoff cannot draw a ring.
  The sky dome (`sky.ts`) is a fourth consumer on the same uniforms: a
  directional horizon-band tint sampled along the view ray, applied before
  the dome's own fog band so the camera zone's fog still owns the true rim.
  The renderer builds the field once from its outdoor fog presets and pushes
  the camera + `dnGrade.fog` per frame; `?zonehaze=off` is the A/B switch.
- **The nameplate suite** (below) owns all overhead text and badges.
- **Pure logic cores** (below) hold Node-tested per-frame decisions.
- **Perf governors:** `render_budget.ts` (adaptive frame budget, see
  Performance) and `crowd_lod.ts` (pure character LOD policy: the band plan
  `characterLodBands` returns, which pulls shadow/anim cadence in as rig counts
  climb and holds an animated far band, articulated rig at a low cadence, before
  the frozen single-draw far mesh takes over. Its extension eases out on the
  crowd knee, the per-tier `GFX.farCharacterAnimScale` ceiling, and live budget
  pressure; cosmetic-only, and `showsStaticFarMesh` keeps anything a player
  reacts to out of the frozen mesh inside the uncrowded base range).
- `view_create_retry.ts`: bounded cooldown state for fail-soft character builds
  in per-frame paths, including required targets, form swaps, and visual-key
  swaps (`tests/view_create_retry.test.ts`).
- `self_motion.ts`/`facing_smooth.ts`: pure display-only self layers (bounded
  online pose extrapolation + rate-limited self yaw; never touch world state,
  see `src/net/CLAUDE.md`).
- `step_smooth_core.ts`/`ground_tilt_core.ts`: the grounded-presentation pair
  the entity loop drives per body. The first eases the vertical step the
  physics solver takes inside one tick (leashed to a step, exact while
  airborne so jumps and landings keep their impact); the second leans a body
  toward the surface under it, in the body's own frame, partial and clamped
  and damped. Both display-only: collision keeps using the physical pose.
  Terrain gradients resample on a per-body TIME budget, never a frame count
  (a frame cadence starves on a slow client). Landing dust rides the same
  loop through `Vfx.groundPuff`, scaled by the display-derived fall speed
  because the wire carries no vy for remote bodies.
- `camera_boom_core.ts`/`camera_feel_core.ts`/`camera_director_core.ts`: the
  AAA chase-camera feel stack `updateCamera` composes (spring-arm pivot lag,
  look-ahead + FOV kicks + landing thump, directed zone-vista/death-drift
  moves). All display-only, all gated by the reduced-motion switch; driven
  from `renderer.ts` `updateCamera` and the hud event hooks
  (`tests/camera_*_core.test.ts`).
- `voxel_terrain.ts`: verification-only prototype (proposal #1611, driven by
  `scripts/`, NOT the live path); live terrain is `terrain.ts` sampling sim heights.

## Module-first: pure core + thin painter (where NEW render logic lands)
New per-frame decision logic (visibility, anchors, interpolation, region/LOD
selection) is its own Three/DOM/i18n-free `*_core.ts` or `*_view.ts` module,
registered in `RENDER_PURE_CORES` (`tests/architecture.test.ts`, which sweeps
every on-disk `src/render` `*_view`/`*_core`, fails CI on unregistered ones,
and scans the set Three/DOM/i18n-free and deterministic). The Three/DOM half
is a thin painter the renderer drives; reference pair: `nameplate_view.ts` +
`nameplate_painter.ts` (the render twin of src/ui's `unit_portrait` pattern).
The core's test is a plain Vitest importing it directly. Fix bugs test-first:
reproduce in the matching Vitest (extract buried logic into a core if needed),
then the smallest change that turns it green; a repro never needs a browser.

## The nameplate suite (overhead text/badges land here, never renderer.ts)
`nameplate_view.ts` is the pure plan (show/hide, anchor lift, urgency, threat,
combo; allocation-free: `nameplatePlanInto` fills a caller-owned `NameplatePlan`).
`nameplate_painter.ts` does the Three projection, DOM writes, and ALL the
localization (per-tier cadence via `ui_tier_knobs.nameplateIntervalSec`); the
significant-contributor name glow lives there too. Narrow helpers:
`nameplate_combo/threat/projection/declutter.ts` plus `entity_labels.ts`
(shared localized display names). Drive changes from `tests/nameplate_*.test.ts`.

## gfx.ts: the shared core (read this before touching any subsystem)
- **`GFX` quality tiers** (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`ultra`). Every tier-dependent knob lives
  here, not in scattered ternaries. The renderer MUST call `initGfxTier(webgl)`
  right after creating the `WebGLRenderer` and before building scene content
  (software GL maps to `low`; `?gfx=low|medium|high|ultra` / `?lowgfx` force a tier).
- **`surfaceMat(opts)`** is the material factory: it dedupes by
  `(color|maps|flags)` so hundreds of boxes share a few programs. Use it instead
  of `new MeshStandardMaterial`; `MeshLambertMaterial` is auto-substituted on low.
- **`sharedUniforms.uTime`** is the one clock for every `onBeforeCompile` shader
  (wind, water, grain); `sync()` ticks it once/frame. `SUN_ANCHOR`/`SUN_DIR` are
  the one sun every consumer (key light, shadows, sky glow, water glints) reads.

## Textures and VFX procedural, models GLB-first
- **Textures:** `textures.ts` builds canvas textures at runtime (no image
  files). Add an `export function xTexture()` using the `makeCanvas` helper; its
  module-local `rnd()` keeps generation deterministic: don't use `Math.random`.
- **VFX:** add an effect to `vfx.ts` (emit into the pooled particle cloud; HDR
  colour multipliers via `hdr()` so it blooms on composer tiers). Sprite atlas
  cells are append-only (`SPRITE_FILES`/`SPR` must stay in sync).
- **Models are real GLB assets** (CC0 kits, Tripo-generated models, and the
  image-to-GLB procedural exporters: props, foliage, dungeon, fish, gather nodes,
  mailbox, delve props, characters, the Eastbrook town kit), loaded via
  `assets/loader.ts`, then baked/merged/instanced at build time. A new
  reference-image asset follows the `image-to-glb` skill
  (`.claude/skills/image-to-glb/SKILL.md`): exporter under `scripts/assets/`, a
  parsed-GLB contract test, and its own thin `src/render/<asset>.ts` adapter
  (exemplars: `banker_chest.ts`, `eastbrook_grand_armoury.ts`, `noticeboard.ts`).
## Asset loading (`assets/`)
`loader.ts` (`loadGltf`/`loadHdr`/`loadTexture`, one parse per URL) plus these
rules, all CI-enforced:
- **Cache results are IMMUTABLE: clone before mutating.** `releaseGltf(url)` drops
  the cache entry after geometry is extracted.
- **`preload.ts` is the boot gate, and it has TWO lanes.** `startGame` awaits
  `assetsReady()` either way, so `build*()` still reads resolved assets
  synchronously; the lanes differ only in WHEN the fetch starts. A new module-load
  fetch MUST register in one of them, and for world content that is the deferred one:
  - `registerDeferredPreload(() => load...())` for world content. Nothing runs until
    `startGame` calls `beginDeferredPreloads()`. The thunk must CREATE the promise
    when invoked, never close over one already in flight.
  - `registerPreload(promise)` stays eager, for the few assets the LAUNCHER itself
    draws. Today that is `characters/assets.ts` (the character-creation preview) and
    `placed_assets.ts` (which runs during world build, not at import).
  Fetching world content at import meant merely reaching the home screen decoded the
  whole set, and the spike crossed WKWebView's per-process ceiling: a 12 GB iPhone 17
  Pro was killed 1.6s in and reloaded forever, unseen by the entry crash guard (it
  only arms inside `startGame`). Guarded by `tests/defer_launcher_preloads.test.ts`,
  which also pins that the lane opens BEFORE the `assetsReady()` that gates the
  Renderer, and fails on any new eager registrant outside the two allowed files.
- **Preload sets are tier-INDEPENDENT.** They freeze at the import-time tier
  guess but placement runs against the LIVE tier, so a preload set must be a
  superset of EVERY tier's placement set or world entry crashes with "asset not
  preloaded" (the v0.16.0 P0; see the comment in `characters/manifest.ts` and
  `tests/render_asset_preload.test.ts`).
- **Every asset under `public/` must be in the media manifest** (regenerate via
  `node scripts/build_media_manifest.mjs generate`, automatic in `npm run build`).
  `tests/render_glb_replacement_assets.test.ts` fails on a GLB missing from
  disk or the manifest; export a `*PreloadInternalsForTest` (see `fish.ts`)
  so it covers your module.

## i18n: overhead labels are the only string surface here
One deliberate exception: `scene_census_core.ts`'s table/format helpers feed the
`?perf` overlay, a dev diagnostic that stays English by the `src/game/CLAUDE.md`
perf-overlay carve-out; never reuse them in player-facing chrome.
The renderer is geometry/shaders; the overhead-text surface is
`nameplate_painter.ts` (owns `t`/`tEntity`/`formatNumber`) plus
`entity_labels.ts` (localized display-name helpers, lifted out of `renderer.ts`
so renderer and painter share them without an import cycle); `renderer.ts`
keeps only `tEntity` for its remaining label writes. Keep it keyed:
- **Entity names** (mob/npc/dungeon/ground-object/ability) localize via `tEntity({
  kind, id, field:'name' })`, never the raw English `e.name`/`e.templateId`.
- **Templated labels** (corpse, dungeon-exit, emote, fishing cast) use `t()` keys.
  The keys live in `src/ui/`, so add a new key there, not inline here.
- **Verbatim by design:** player names and owned-pet names (`e.name` when
  `e.ownerId !== null`) are proper nouns: splice them as-is, do not localize.
- **Deed titles** (the subtitle under a player's name): the entity `title`
  field is a deed id; `nameplate_painter.ts` resolves it via `deedTitleText`
  (`../ui/deed_i18n`), diffed per language + deed id; an unknown id hides the
  line.
- `cast_bar.ts` stays i18n-free on purpose: it returns a stable discriminator
  (`label`/`fishing`) and `nameplate_painter.ts` resolves the visible text.
  Don't add `t()` there.

## Terrain height = sim height (hard invariant)
Render samples `terrainHeight` / `groundHeight` from `src/sim/world.ts` (DOM-free,
deterministic) to place terrain, props, foliage, water-shore depth. **YOU MUST
sample those functions, never re-derive height here.** `groundHeight` is the
dungeon-aware wrapper (flat floor past `DUNGEON_X_THRESHOLD`); plain
`terrainHeight` is the open-world surface. If they drift, visuals desync from
collision/movement.

## Performance discipline: this runs at frame rate
- Three.js is **version-pinned in `package.json`**; the post chain lives in
  `post.ts` (its header comment documents the pass order and the N8AO
  subtleties) plus the `n8ao` package (SSAO). The `postprocessing` dep in
  `package.json` is n8ao's peer dependency, not imported directly, so don't
  remove it as "unused." Don't bump Three or swap the chain casually: shaders
  here patch the pinned release's shader chunks via `onBeforeCompile`, so any
  bump means re-verifying every patched chunk. A bump also touches KTX2:
  `assets/ktx2_support.ts` hand-builds a `workerConfig` on its no-context
  fallback arm (a shape KTX2Loader owns and can change between releases), and
  the shipped `public/basis/` transcoder must be regenerated from the new three
  via `node scripts/patch_basis_transcoder.mjs` (never a raw copy: the shipped
  JS carries an eval-free embind patch so the KTX2 blob worker survives the
  Electron shell CSP, which has no 'unsafe-eval'). `tests/glb_texture_compression.test.ts`
  pins shipped === patch(vendored) and `tests/basis_transcoder_csp.test.ts` pins
  the no-dynamic-code invariant; both go red on a raw re-copy.
- Reuse, don't allocate: instancing for repeats, merge one-offs per
  (material, z-band), share materials via `surfaceMat`, distance-cull/LOD in
  `sync` (see the `*_RANGE_SQ` constants). No per-frame `new THREE.*` in hot paths;
  reuse the `tmpV` scratch vectors / scratch arrays already in `renderer.ts`.
  The VFX world-anchor seam follows the same rule with an explicit contract:
  `vfx_anchor.ts` `createVfxAnchor` takes an optional caller-owned destination,
  so a per-frame path passes its own scratch (the reading is valid only until
  that scratch is reused) and a one-shot spawn path omits it and gets a fresh
  retainable vector.
- **A cosmetic subsystem answers to a lever, and the lever says which job it is
  doing.** `weapon_vfx_shed_core.ts` is the shape to copy: it FADES (both arms
  floored above the multiplier at which a part stops drawing) and leaves REMOVAL
  to the character LOD swap, which already owns it on inputs the whole render
  path shares. Read its header before adding a shed of your own, including why
  the distance arm is anchored to the fixed `CHARACTER_LOD_RANGE_SQ` and not to
  the live crowd-adaptive band edge, and
  `docs/design/graphics-settings-fairness.md` for why that choice is what keeps
  a fade fairness-safe.
- **Work that a hidden subtree cannot show is work not to do.** The far-LOD swap
  hides `modelWrap`, so anything parented into the rig (a held weapon and its
  VFX) stops being drawn without any of its own flags changing; a per-frame
  driver over such a subtree should skip. Check the swap ACTUALLY happened
  (`CharacterVisual.setFar` keeps the rig visible when no baked mesh exists,
  while `isFar` reads true either way), never just the intent flag.
- **Cloning a material? Use `material_clone_hooks.ts`.** `Material.clone()` copies
  userData but silently DROPS `onBeforeCompile`, and three keys its program cache
  on `customProgramCacheKey()`, whose default return value IS
  `onBeforeCompile.toString()`. So a bare clone of a patched material (rim glow,
  the worn surface-detail layer) both renders un-patched AND links a whole new
  program on its first draw, wherever that draw lands. `cloneMaterialWithHooks`
  re-attaches exactly the layers the source carried, in the source's order, so
  the composed key comes out identical and the clone reuses the linked program.
- **`render_budget.ts` is the renderer's adaptive-budget core** (tier-driven frame
  budget + telemetry, keyed off `gfx.ts` quality bands). `renderer.ts` owns it,
  degrades against it, and pushes the resulting grass/foliage/vfx quality levels into
  those subsystems. Consult it rather than reinventing a frame-level budget.
