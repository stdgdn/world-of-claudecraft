// i18n source catalog - the public Guide (docs/wiki) surface served at /wiki. A curated,

// it replaced is retired). English values only; the locale translations live in
// src/ui/i18n.locales/<lang>.ts (the runtime-authoritative overlays), filled by the
// maintainer at release.
//
// Assembled into `en` by ./index.ts under the `guide` namespace. Like hud_chrome.ts

Against other players, control wears thin with repetition: the same kind reapplied too quickly weakens and then fails outright, and a stun that opens from stealth is counted apart from the stuns that follow, so nobody can be chained helpless forever.

    deathBody:
      "If your health reaches zero you are downed where you stand, and your body stays there. Release your spirit and you rise as a ghost at the nearest graveyard: faster on its feet than the living, beyond the reach of your enemies, but unable to fight, loot, or speak with anyone except the Pale Keeper hovering over the stones. From there you choose. Run your ghost back to your body and you revive on the spot with part of your health and mana restored and no penalty at all. Or take the Pale Keeper up on an instant raise where you stand, at the price of the Keeper's Toll: a temporary weakening of all you are that lasts longer the more seasoned you are, and spares brand-new characters entirely. Fall inside a dungeon and your spirit waits at the graveyard outside; walk your ghost back through the door and you revive at the entrance. Delves are the exception: fall there and you are simply set back on your feet at the delve's entry, though a second fall ends the run. Either road, you lose no experience, gear, or coin. Between fights, sit to eat and drink so you start the next one at full strength.",

    a1: 'Yes. The whole game is free to play to the level cap, and the source code is open on GitHub.',
    q2: 'Do I need a crypto wallet or any tokens?',
    a2: 'No. The game is fully playable without one. The optional community token only adds cosmetic flair and a share of the daily rewards prize pool, and it never affects power or progression.',
    q3: 'Can I play on my phone?',
    a3: 'Yes. The game runs in a mobile browser with touch controls, and there is a desktop launcher as well.',
    q4: 'Can I play offline or solo?',
    a4: 'Yes. There is an instant single-player offline mode, and the online world is fully soloable apart from dungeons, the raid, and the world boss.',
    q5: 'How many classes are there?',
    a5: 'Nine, covering the classic tank, healer, and damage roles, each with a resource system (rage, mana, or energy) and its own signature abilities.',
    q6: 'What is the level cap?',
    a6: 'Level {cap}, reached across three connected zones of quests, dungeons, and exploration.',
    q7: 'Will my character be saved?',
    a7: 'Online characters are saved on the server automatically. Offline characters live in your browser for quick sessions and testing.',
    q8: 'Can I host my own copy?',
    a8: 'Yes. The project is open source, so you can run your own server. See the GitHub repository.',
    q9: 'Is there PvP?',
    a9: 'Yes. Duel anyone for fun, or step into the Ashen Coliseum to fight other players. PvP is opt in, so you are never forced into it.',
    q10: 'What is there to do at max level?',
    a10: 'The cap is level {cap}. From there you run the five-player dungeons and the ten-player raid, take them on again in heroic mode for upgraded loot, face the world boss when he rises, test yourself in the arena, drop into delves with a companion at your side, and chase deeds in the Book of Deeds to climb the realm standings.',
    q11: 'How do I find a group?',
    a11: 'Invite anyone you meet to a party, ask in chat, or team up at a dungeon. Most of the world is soloable, so grouping is a choice, not a requirement.',

Every character can raise seven of the eight crafts that have content today and all four gathering professions side by side (Engineering is the one holdout: its recipes all start above the free ceiling, so its ladder waits for the Bombardier's oath); the only exclusive choice is your archetype, the identity you eventually swear to, though once you attune the crafts that fall dormant behind it climb only on their common recipes, and past skill 75 not at all.

Four pairs can be joined today (Smith, Outfitter, Apothecary, and Bombardier), each anchored by a resident master in Eastbrook whose acceptance quest states the whole bargain up front before you take it. Until you declare, every craft advances freely on recipes up through the rare tier (any recipe asking skill 74 or less), so you can try nearly everything before you choose (Engineering alone has no recipe that low, so its number waits).\n\nOnce you attune, your two pair crafts become your majors, with no ceiling short of the cap. The rest of the wheel does not go dark: one craft opposite your majors stays on as a hobby that keeps climbing through the rare tier (a repeatable quest at Smith Haldren's forge lets you swap which one), and every other craft goes dormant. A dormant craft keeps its skill and its common recipes, which keep teaching it on the normal curve until they gray at 75; everything above common stops paying at once, and a dormant craft never turns out a masterwork while it rests.",

Gains are deterministic, never a skill-up roll, so the same craft at the same tier always moves your skill by exactly the same amount, and a recipe turning yellow is your cue to train the next rung.\n\nGathering runs on the same curve with the same tier step, scored against the node instead of a recipe: easy nodes gray out as you pass them, and the richer nodes of the later zones are what finish a climb.

Tiers 1 through 3 of every tool line are ordinary vendor stock; tiers 4 and 5 come off an engineer's bench, or out of the Drowned Litany's delve counter for Delve Marks behind its clears gates, and never out of any till for coin.\n\nOn the ring it sits with the trial-and-error trades, next to Alchemy and Armorcrafting, giving it two pair identities: the Bombardier (Engineering and Alchemy, taken up before Gizzel himself) and the Gearwright (Armorcrafting and Engineering, named but not yet swearable). One warning matters more here than anywhere else: every one of Engineering's recipe rungs sits above the rare-tier ceiling that hobbies and undeclared crafters work under, so the skill number only moves for a crafter whose majors include Engineering, which today means the Bombardier. Anyone can still build the land tools; an unattuned crafter just learns nothing from doing it, and the two rod recipes ask for Gizzel's teaching besides.",

          "Every land tool recipe consumes the tool one tier below it plus a FINE material, and that pairing is the whole land ladder: four Fine Iron Ore and a Skysilver Mining Pick become the Osmium Mining Pick, then two Glyphsteel Bars, two Fine Osmium Ore and that osmium pick become the Glyphsteel Mining Pick. The axe and sickle lines mirror the fine-plus-prior-tool shape with Fine Ashwood and Fine Highpine Logs, Fine Goldleaf and Fine Sunpetal Herbs, though their tier 5 rungs ask no Glyphsteel Bars: the pick is the one line that gets dearer at the top. The two rod recipes break the pattern on purpose: the Stormreel takes four Sunglint Koi and a Silverstream rod, the Tidewrought two Koi, eight Raw Slatefin Carp and that Stormreel, so the top of the angler's ladder is paid for on the water rather than at a vein.\n\nA fine material is not sold anywhere and does not drop from an ordinary harvest: you get it by working one of a zone's full-grade veins with a tool ranked above the material itself, which in practice means the tool one rung below the one you are trying to build (the easier veins a zone keeps for travellers yield the plain material whatever you swing). That is deliberate. On the craft route, a tier 5 tool comes from actually swinging the tier 4 one, not from a shopping trip; the Delve Marks counter is the one way around it. The single exception is the Glyphsteel Bar, refined and vendor-only, 1 silver 60 copper a bar from Quartermaster Bree in Highwatch or from Gizzel's own counter, so the Glyphsteel Mining Pick alone carries a fixed coin floor built into its cost.",

That second number is not a typo, and it sits above the current 125 cap on purpose: skill requirements never gate a craft here, they only shape skill gain, so you can build a tier 5 tool the day you hold its reagents and its tier 4 predecessor. The two crafted rods are the taught exception: Gizzel teaches the Stormreel at skill 75 for 4 gold and the Tidewrought at skill 125 for 16 gold, each the moment your tier in the craft reaches its own.\n\nEvery finished tool is rare or epic quality and comes out signed, so your name rides the zones on other players' toolbelts.

The gain math barely fades here: the skill 75 recipes pay full gain until 100 and half after, and the skill 150 recipes pay full gain all the way to the 125 cap, so the real constraint is reagents and coin, never gray recipes.\n\nPick your pair first, because nothing moves without it: take the Bombardier attunement from Tinker Gizzel. Then feed the ladder: level Mining, Logging, or Herbalism yourself or befriend gatherers, buy the tier 3 tools from vendors, and treat Gizzel's work order (eight Ironbark Logs for 16 copper, repeatable every 30 minutes) as walking-around money.\n\nEngineering is a low-volume prestige trade, roughly one skill point per finished tool, so treat every craft as stock for sale. The pitch to your customers writes itself: each tool tier above a node's own trims 0.4 seconds off the 2.5 second harvest cast (down to a 1.5 second floor), so a tier 5 tool is a speed upgrade on every node in the world, and only you can make one.

Each success is worth up to one point, scaled by how serious the work is: the rarity of the piece you break, or the reagent tier of the enchant you apply. Common disenchants and dust-only enchants score as common work; uncommon disenchants and essence enchants as uncommon; rare disenchants and every Runed or Greater enchant as rare; epic and legendary disenchants rank higher still on the table, though no enchanting identity today reaches past the rare rung, so they pay the same as rare work in practice. One honesty rules the breaking bench: a piece that came off a player bench (crafted, signed, or masterworked) still mills into materials but teaches nothing, so a craft-and-break loop levels no one, and the lessons are in world-found gear.\n\nThe familiar mastery fade applies on 25-point tiers, so common-grade work goes gray at skill 75, uncommon work at 100, and rare-tier work exactly at the 125 cap. Enchanting also has one kindness of its own: input above your archetype ceiling is rounded down to that ceiling instead of zeroed, so before you attune, an epic disenchant simply scores as rare rather than teaching nothing. If Enchanting ends up dormant behind another identity, breaking and applying score as common work and the climb stalls at 75, while the two charms, riding the crafting curve above the common ceiling, teach a dormant enchanter nothing at all; keep it as your hobby and rare-tier work still pays, just slower past 75.',

Point it at a bagged copy and you get back a distinct enchanted copy; point it at a piece you are already wearing and it is enchanted in place, right where it sits, with no unequip and re-equip dance. Either way the bonus follows that piece forever, through unequips, bank trips, and trades. One enchant per piece: applying a different enchant to an enchanted copy asks for confirmation, then replaces the old enchant outright, destroying it with no refund of its materials. Selling, discarding, and disenchanting all prefer plain copies first, so your finished piece does not get eaten by accident.\n\nMasterwork gear and enchanting are friends: a masterwork piece stays fully enchantable, and the enchant adds on top of the masterwork bonus without disturbing it or the maker's signature. Stacking every source, a signed masterwork carrying a Greater enchant is the best a crafted piece gets, and it still sits below raid loot by design.\n\nOn the market, an enchanted or signed piece lists like anything else: it goes up as its own single-copy listing, the tooltip shows the enchant and the maker's mark, and the Ravenpost carries it just as faithfully. The materials remain the steady half of the craft: Dust, Essence, and Shards list freely, listing costs nothing, and the Merchant takes 5 percent of a completed sale only.

Every counter sells every rung it stocks freely, and any tool passes by direct trade; every rung also lists on the Market and travels by mail except the three 20-copper land starters: those are bought at a counter or passed hand to hand, and never sold back, mailed, or listed. What is gated is the wielding. A land tool above tier 1 works only once your proficiency in its own trade has earned it, {tier2Prof} for tier 2, {tier3Prof} for tier 3, and 85 and 100 for the two crafted rungs, and the vendor row, the tooltip, and the table below all name the requirement up front. Until then a tool bought ahead simply waits in your bags, opening no ground, buying no speed, and minting no fine grades, then wields the moment your counter touches its number. Fishing rods are the one exception: no rod carries a wield requirement, and Trader Wilkes in Eastbrook deliberately stocks the tier 2 and tier 3 rods for anglers buying ahead. A tool never occupies an equip slot and never wears out, so each is a one-time purchase, and only the tier matters to the gate: a rarer tool of the same tier opens nothing extra. Rarity is not only colour, though. It makes a slotted tool effect last longer, and on a rod it widens the reel window.\n\nA better tool buys three things, not two. It opens higher-tier ground, it shortens the cast, and it improves what comes out: work a vein with a tool ranked ABOVE the zone's own material and the harvest yields the fine grade of it instead of the plain one. The vein has to be one of the zone's full-grade ones, so the easier veins a zone keeps for travellers still yield the ordinary material. Fine materials are what the crafted tool recipes consume, and a fine grade counts as its ordinary version anywhere a recipe or a work order asks for one, so upgrading never strands you: it just means your copper ore arrives as Fine Copper Ore.\n\nAbove the vendor ladder each trade has two crafted tools, tier 4 and tier 5, made at the toolworks (every character knows the land recipes; the skill that climbs for the work is Engineering's), or bought with Delve Marks at the Drowned Litany counter once its clears gates are met: the table below carries the Marks price and the clears each rung asks.

No water asks for them, so they buy a shorter wait and a wider reel window instead of access, which at the top rung means a bite in a flat three seconds.",

A whole session caps at {cap} seconds, so even a quiet cast resolves quickly.\n\nBetter rods sharpen both ends of the minigame: each rod tier above the first trims {rod} seconds off the longest possible wait, never below the three-second floor the top rod already grazes, and adds {reelRod} seconds to the reel window, so the Ironreel pulls the worst wait down to 6.5 seconds with a 3.25 second window, and the Silverstream to 5 with a window past 4, its rarity widening the reel a little beyond what the tier alone pays.

The water itself caps the lesson too: the Vale's tier 1 waters (and every young shore beyond the heartland) teach nothing past 100, the marsh's stop at 150, and only Thornpeak's school an angler the whole way to 200.

Each band above the first also demands a rod: band 1 wants the tier 2 Ironreel, band 2 the tier 3 Silverstream. Your effective band is the lower of what your skill has earned and what your rod supports, and the cap is silent: with a lesser rod you still catch, just off the lower band's table, so if your catches feel stuck while your skill climbs, check your rod first.\n\nEach zone's waters hold their own pair of cooking catches, higher-tier fish the deeper the zone, all of them kitchen reagents that must be cooked before they restore anything. The rest of the table is the angler's tax: weed, the occasional boot, and the empty hook, which never fully disappears. How much you pay depends on the water your bobber lands in, not where you stand: a cast reaches up to 24 yards, and the rod the water demands, the table it draws from, the deed it credits, and how far it teaches all answer to the zone that water belongs to, decided the moment the line lands. Each zone's water is written for a band of its own, the Vale for band 0, the marsh for band 1, the peaks for band 2, and fishing one band under that turns roughly a third of your casts into empty hooks, two bands under it more than half. The rod gets you to the water; the skill is what makes it pay, and the climb is what pulls an angler deeper, because better bands are not just better pay: past the Vale they are the only waters that keep teaching. The {rare} is the one row that answers to your catch band and nothing else: the same odds in every zone, and six times likelier at band 2 than at band 0, so the rarest thing on the dock is the one a Master Angler really is better at.",

A signature is part of the item itself, travels with it through trades, the bank, the mail, the World Market, and even a vendor buyback, and never fades.\n\nGathering signs its best work automatically: any harvest that rolls rare or better arrives signed, and rare finds sign their entire five-fold windfall. A corpse harvest's lucky roll signs its yield where the family has no specimen to give, and where it does, keeps the yield plain and mints the signed pristine specimen beside it. Crafting signs along the same line: every copy of a rare or better output mints signed, and a masterwork always signs whatever its quality, so the finest version of any piece always names its maker. The one thing that can cost you a signature is a full bag: a signed unit needs room of its own, or a matching signed stack, to land in.\n\nA stack of items shares one identity, so two copies merge only when every mark matches exactly: same item, same signer, same masterwork stats, same enchant, same bond. A signed log never joins a plain pile in either direction (merging would erase somebody's name), but identical payloads merge happily, so twenty ore signed by the same gatherer sit in one stack and a windfall does not shred your bags.\n\nSignatures pay crafters back: holding any signed copy of a needed reagent at the bench, whoever signed it, adds 2 percentage points of masterwork chance, and holding a reagent signed by your own hand cuts that reagent's required quantity by one (never below one). Your own signed rare-or-better work even keeps teaching you, today through the flask alone: drink a potion you signed and a small trickle of skill flows back to the craft that brewed it, as long as that craft is one of your active majors.",

      title: 'Professions FAQ',
      intro: 'Quick answers to the questions crafters ask most.',
      q1: 'Why do my signed items not stack?',
      a1: 'A signed item is an instanced item: it carries its own little record (the signer, any rolled quality, masterwork stats, an enchant, a bond) instead of being an anonymous copy. Two copies merge into one stack only when those records match exactly.\n\nIn practice: rare ore you gathered yourself stacks with more rare ore you gathered yourself, because both say Gathered by you and nothing else differs. The same material signed by a friend sits in its own slot, and a plain unsigned copy never merges into a signed stack. Bags, bank, trade, mail, and the World Market all follow this one rule.',
      q2: 'Do common recipes raise my skill forever?',
      a2: 'No. Every recipe is scored by how far it sits below your current bracket in that craft, the classic orange, yellow, green, gray reading: full gain at or above your bracket, half one tier below, a quarter two tiers below, and nothing three or more below. Brackets are every 25 skill, so the free skill 0 recipes stop teaching you anything at 75 skill.\n\nThe caps are also lower than the classic 300 you might expect: each of the eight earnable crafts caps at 125, Mining, Logging, and Herbalism cap at 100, and Fishing runs long at 200. Climbing means moving up to recipes at your own bracket, not grinding the cheapest one.',
      q3: 'What is the difference between looting and harvesting a corpse?',
      a3: 'One press covers both. Everything a corpse holds, coin and drops plus any harvestable components, opens in the same window: loot follows the normal loot rules, and harvesting is the professions side, stripping materials off the carcass itself.\n\nHarvesting is first come, single use: each corpse can be harvested exactly once, by whoever claims it first, online included. Your Town Focus shapes what you get: while standing in a town hub you can spread 10 focus points across the component types you care about, and each focused component rolls a better tier (every 5 points bumps it a step, at most two steps) and yields more (10 percent per point). Unfocused components are never made worse.',
      q4: 'Why is my Ironbark Log signed?',
      a4: 'You hit a windfall. Roughly 1 harvest in 90 triggers a rare gather event (ancient heartwood on a tree, a pristine vein on ore, a moonlit bloom on herbs): it multiplies the yield five times, signs every unit with your name, and announces the find to the whole zone. A rare or better rarity roll on an ordinary harvest signs the yield too.\n\nSigned materials are worth keeping or selling dear: holding any signed copy of a needed reagent at the bench adds 2 percentage points to the masterwork chance. Just remember they only stack with identically signed copies, so they keep their own bag slot.',
      q5: 'How do I unbind a commissioned piece, and what does it cost?',
      a5: "Walk to any crafting station with the piece in your bags and pay the master. The fee follows the item's quality: 25 silver for an uncommon piece, 1 gold for a rare, 4 gold for an epic; a legendary pays the epic rate, and a commissioned common piece pays the uncommon rate. It must be a real station: a mobile station never offers the service.\n\nThe fee buys a clean slate, not a cure: the piece remains a commission, so it binds again to whoever receives it in the next trade. If several bound copies share a stack, one copy is peeled off and unbound per payment.",
      q6: 'Where do I learn recipes, and what do they cost?',
      a6: "The nine common field recipes and the six crafted land-tool recipes are known to everyone from the start, and so are three station-bound capstones (the Kilnscale Mantle, the Wardweave Cowl, and the Duskhide Wraps), which need no trainer, only their station. Everything else is taught by the resident masters at their stations across the three hub towns: most stand in Eastbrook, the tanner keeps the tannery in Fenbridge, and the alchemist keeps the apothecary in Highwatch.\n\nTrainer recipes run in rungs: skill 0, 25, and 50 for the gear and consumable crafts, priced free, 25 silver, and 1 gold as one-time fees; Enchanting's two charm recipes sit on the 25 rung, and the toolmaker teaches the two crafted fishing rods at 75 and 125 for 4 and 16 gold. A master teaches a recipe once your bracket in that craft has reached the recipe's own bracket, and you must be standing at their station to learn: a mobile station does not count.",
      q7: 'Why did my gathering suddenly slow down?',
      a7: "The gather cast starts at 2.5 seconds and is shaved down two ways: 0.4 seconds for every tool tier you carry and can wield above the node's own tier, and 0.15 seconds once your trade's counter crosses its 100 band, with a floor of 1.5 seconds. Move from tier 1 nodes up to tier 3 nodes and your surplus vanishes, so the same pick swings slower again. Holding exactly the required tier buys no speed; it only opens the node.\n\nSkill gain fades the same way crafting does: a node grays out as your proficiency climbs past its tier (tier 1 nodes teach nothing from proficiency 75 on), so the answer to slow gains is higher tier nodes. Those need a tool of at least their tier in your bags (no node is ever worked bare-handed, tier 1 included), and a land tool above tier 1 also wants its wield mark first, 40/70/85/100 in its own trade for tiers 2 through 5. Fishing follows its own taper: full gain below 50 proficiency, half below 100, a trickle of 0.1 below 150 and 0.02 below 200, junk catches teach nothing at all from 100 on, and the water itself caps the lesson (tier 1 waters stop teaching at 100, the marsh at 150), so a stalled counter can also mean you have outgrown the water.",
      q8: 'Can I craft away from town?',
      a8: "Partly. The nine common field recipes (the starter weapon, armor, food, and potion staples) craft anywhere, any time, and so do the three combination recipes of the sworn pairs. Everything else above them is bound to a station type: forge, kitchens, apothecary, tannery, loom, or toolworks, and you must be within 20 yards of the station for the craft to go through.\n\nAt 75 skill in a craft you specialize, and along with a 20 percent material discount you gain a mobile station: place it in the field and it stands for 10 minutes, serving that craft's recipes as if you were at the real thing. The mobile station is for crafting only: learning recipes and unbinding commissions always require the true station in town.",

    agiTitle: 'Agility',
    agiBody:
      "Agility sharpens you in several ways: it raises your chance to land a critical hit and your chance to dodge, and it adds a little armor. For rogues and hunters it also feeds attack power, and it drives a hunter's ranged shots.",
    staTitle: 'Stamina',

      'Stamina is your staying power. More Stamina means a larger health pool, and it speeds the health you recover while resting out of combat. Every class wants some.',
    intTitle: 'Intellect',

      "Intellect grows a spellcaster's mana pool, raises their spell power so their spells hit harder, and improves the chance their spells crit. It matters to the classes that cast from mana; for a Rage or Energy class it does little.",
    spiTitle: 'Spirit',

    spTitle: 'Spell power',
    spBody:
      "Spell power is a caster's counterpart to attack power: it raises the damage your spells deal. Intellect feeds it, and caster gear and buffs add more on top, so a spellcaster watches spell power the way a melee fighter watches attack power.",
    critTitle: 'Critical strike',
    critBody:
      'Your critical strike chance is how often an attack lands for extra damage. Everyone starts with a small base chance, and Agility (plus some talents and gear) builds on it. Your sheet shows both the chance itself and the critical strike rating your gear contributes toward it.',
    dodgeTitle: 'Dodge',
    dodgeBody:
      'Dodge is your chance to avoid an incoming melee attack entirely. You begin with a small base chance, and Agility raises it, so nimble classes slip more blows.',
    hasteTitle: 'Haste',
    hasteBody:
      'Haste is one stat that quickens everything you do: melee swings, ranged shots, and spellcasting all speed up together. It comes from gear, most notably armor-set bonuses, while a few abilities grant a short burst of quicker swings. Your sheet shows it as Haste Rating.',

It feeds a cosmetic virtual level, so your experience bar keeps climbing, and a long-term prestige rank you can claim from your character sheet once you are there.
