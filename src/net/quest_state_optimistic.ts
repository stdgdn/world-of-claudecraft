// Pure optimistic quest-state resolution for the online client.
//
// Bug fixed (issue 1667): after turning in a quest through the NPC dialog, a
// follow-up quest that requires it (`requiresQuest`) stayed hidden until the
// next server snapshot arrived, even though the dialog re-renders immediately
// after the turn-in command is sent. `ClientWorld.turnInQuest` is fire-and-
// forget: it records the action in `pendingQuestCommands` but the quest only
// actually leaves `questLog` / lands in `questsDone` once the server's `qlog`/
// `qdone` snapshot fields round-trip. The dialog's re-render (`hud.ts`
// `renderGossip`) already re-queries `questState()` live for every quest the
// NPC could offer, so the staleness was never in the UI layer: it was that
// `computeQuestState`'s prerequisite check (`quest.requiresQuest &&
// !questsDone.has(...)`) read the not-yet-updated `questsDone` set for any
// quest OTHER than the one just turned in.
//
// The fix extends the existing pending-command optimism (already sanctioned
// for the turned-in quest itself, see src/net/CLAUDE.md) to prerequisite
// checks for every other quest: while a `turnin` command is in flight, treat
// that quest as done when resolving anyone else's state. This is display-only
// optimism reconciled the moment a real snapshot lands and clears
// `pendingQuestCommands` (see `ClientWorld.applySnapshot`); the server still
// authoritatively resolves the turn-in itself.
