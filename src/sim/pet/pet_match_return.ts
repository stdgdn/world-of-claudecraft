// Pet return across an arena-shaped match (ranked arena, Fiesta, Protect Yumi).
//
// The bout is a parenthesis, not a rest stop (issue #1600): startArenaMatch
// snapshots what each fighter carried in and returnFromArena hands it back, so a
// match can never be farmed as a free full restore. The fighter's PET was the one
// thing that seam never covered: the arena clean slate stands the FIGHTER back up
// on the way out (returnFromArena sets `dead = false`), but a beast killed on the
// sands, or one dragged down with its owner by the handleDeath owner arm, stayed a
// corpse. A hunter who queued with a living pet went home without one and owed a
// Revive Pet cast for a death the normalized bout inflicted.
//
// This slice owns the three parts of that round trip and nothing else:
//   - snapshotMatchPet: taken at match formation, records the pet ENTITY ID, the hp
//     it walked in at, and a full rebuild payload, and only for a LIVING pet (a
//     fighter who queued with a corpse is owed nothing, so the arena can never be a
//     free pet revive).
//   - noteMatchPetUnravelled: stamped at the corpse-decay unravel in
//     mob/locomotion.ts, the one place that means "the world removed this corpse".
//   - restoreMatchPet: called at the END of the return path, after the fighter is
//     already standing at their queue spot, so the beast is placed beside its owner
//     in the world instead of back on the sands.
//
// Every pet class is covered, but by two different arms, because a corpse does not
// mean the same thing to each. A hunter's beast and a mage's Water Elemental keep
// their corpse indefinitely (mob/locomotion.ts returns early for any non-demon owned
// pet), so those are revived IN PLACE, same entity. A warlock's demon unravels within
// seconds of dying (handleDeath gives an owned demon corpseTimer 3, then despawnPet
// removes it), so there is nothing left to revive and it is REBUILT from the payload.
//
// The rebuild arm is deliberately the narrow one, and it keys on the UNRAVEL, never
// on the death. A missing entity is not evidence of anything by itself: abandonPet
// accepts a dead pet and drops its entity too, so keying on "the bout killed it"
// would hand a hunter back the corpse they deliberately abandoned mid-bout. Only
// the corpse-decay unravel in mob/locomotion.ts stamps the snapshot, and the
// rebuild additionally refuses when the owner already has a pet standing.
//
// `src/sim`-pure and rng-free: no DOM/Three/render/ui/game/net imports, no
// Math.random/Date.now, and no draw sites (the revive is straight-line state).
