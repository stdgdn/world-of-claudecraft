// Spell avoidance, classic-era semantics: a spell can never "miss" the way a
// physical attack does; instead a target can fully RESIST it. The chance of a
// full resist is the complement of the level-based spell-hit chance
// (`spellHitChance` in types.ts), so a higher-level target resists a caster's
// spells exactly as often as it would have made them "miss" before. Shared by
// the player cast path (combat/casting_lifecycle.ts), the pet ranged-spell
// path (sim.ts), and the player pet bolt path (pet/pet_ai.ts petRangedAttack)
// so all three label the outcome the same way.

// UNFLOORED branch: mobAttacker requires ownerId === null, so the floor below
// never binds and the pet keeps the full above-level resist scaling, exactly
// like a player cast. Mirrors swingMissChance's
// hostile-mob / player-side guard: a hostile wild mob (or its ranged attack)
// casting at a player or player-owned pet has its resist chance floored so it
// still hits at least (1 - MOB_VS_PLAYER_MAX_RESIST) of the time; player/pet ->
// mob keeps the full above-level resist scaling untouched. Draws exactly one rng
// value, same as isSpellResisted, so the global draw order is unchanged.

// Unlike mobArmorReduction, this cap is NOT further gated on caster.level <
// target.level: spellHitChance already returns >= 96% whenever the caster is at or
// above the target's level (diff <= 0), which always clears the 80% floor on its
// own, so the Math.max below is a no-op there and an explicit level check would be
// redundant. If spellHitChance's at-or-above-level branch is ever tuned below 80%,
// re-check this comment: the cap would start binding above-level too.
