// Pure, host-agnostic vendor purchase quantity math: the one leaf owning the
// row-unit model for the sim's authoritative buy path (items.ts buyItem) and
// the vendor window's UI preview (ui/hud/vendor/vendor_view.ts consumes the
// force-1 predicate and the prompt cap; it recomputes the display total from
// the same row-unit price, held in lockstep by a cross-check in
// tests/vendor_view.test.ts), so no vendor affordance can promise a quantity
// the server would not grant.
//
// Two purchase axes live here, deliberately together (one seam, phase 21):
// - The bulk ("buy stack") verb, #2374: classic vendors sell most goods one
//   unit per click (buying 20 crafting reagents took 20 clicks); a bulk
//   purchase buys as many units as the player can currently afford, capped at
//   the item's real bag stack size (src/sim/bags.ts stackSizeOf), never
//   erroring for wanting more than one: the caller (items.ts buyItem) floors
//   the result at 1 so an unaffordable request still surfaces the ordinary
//   "Not enough money" error instead of silently buying zero. Unit-based by
//   design: a bulk food buy may grant a non-multiple of the 5-unit row unit.
// - The count path (the 1x/5x/10x/custom control row): row-unit-based, a
//   count of N is N ordinary purchases resolved atomically. Counts are
//   sanitized (sanitizeBuyCount), never coerced; totals are overflow-guarded
//   BEFORE any balance compare (buyPurchaseTotals); and the Q23 force-1 rows
//   (vendorCountForced) never multiply.
//
// Soulbound stays force-1 on BOTH axes: vendorCountForced forces it on the
// count path, and bulkEligible (items.ts buyItem AND vendor_view.ts's own
// preview predicate) excludes it from the bulk path the same way it already
// excludes honor-priced rows and mounts, so a future soulbound stackable (no
// such row exists today; the only soulbound row with a buyValue is a mount,
// force-1 on both paths regardless) can never bulk-multiply while the count
// path pins it to 1.
//
// DOM-free and deterministic so tests/vendor_buy_stack.test.ts drives it directly.
