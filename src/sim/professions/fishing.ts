// Fishing profession command logic, behind the SimContext seam (Professions
// 2.0; the bite minigame). startFishing begins the fishing
// session (the fishing-pole item use routes here via SimContext,
// src/sim/items.ts) and draws ONE hidden seeded bite delay; the cast
// lifecycle (src/sim/combat/casting_lifecycle.ts) fires the bite and the
// got-away miss off hidden tick deadlines; a pole RE-press inside the armed
// reel window (the reel arm at the top of startFishing) lands the catch
// through completeFishing's single table draw. Fishing is a full gathering
// proficiency (GATHERING_PROFESSIONS.fishing): a landed catch queues a
// proficiency grant on the tick path like any other gathering harvest, and
// the accrued proficiency selects a catch rarity band (fishingBandFor) whose
// per-zone table shifts weight out of grey-junk/empty-hook rows and into
// cooking catches as skill rises. Where a zone's water sits on that ladder,
// and which rod it takes to cast there at all, live in professions/fishing_zones.ts.
// Draw contract: a normal session draws one rng
// value at cast start (the bite delay) and one more at a landed reel (the
// table); a miss stays at one, as does an early reel (a pre-bite re-press
// ends the session empty, the anti-spam arm in startFishing); the codfather
// reel draws nothing (early return); a bags-full reel still draws the table
// (capacity gates after the roll). Band selection is pure state, not a draw,
// and every deny arm is draw-free.

  // depends on it. Fall back to the Vale table for any spot without its own
  // (e.g. fishable water inside a dungeon zone), per band.
  // Rod gating: catch band b requires tool tier b + 1 (the shared
  // canGatherTier comparator), so band 0, the shipped table, is always
  // reachable: the simple pole and bare hands both resolve to effective tier 1
  // via bestOwnedGatherToolTier's bare-hands floor. Effective band =
  // min(proficiency band, best band the owned rod tier covers). The cap is
  // SILENT by design: no event and no denial, the cast still lands a
  // band-capped catch (the effective band does ride the owner's own outcome
  // events for the telemetry, so "silent" means no denial, not secret). All
  // of this is pure state resolved before the single rng draw below, so the
  // one-draw-per-catch contract and every existing seed's catch sequence are
  // untouched.
  //
  // TWO ROD RULES, KEPT SEPARATE ON PURPOSE, because they answer different
  // questions and a player reads them differently. The zone gate in
  // startFishing decides ACCESS and DENIES out loud (no cast, a named tier in
  // the toast). This cap decides QUALITY and stays silent (the cast lands, one
  // band lower). Folding them into one rule breaks whichever half it adopts: a
  // silent zone gate would leave a player casting forever into water that can
  // never pay them, and a loud quality cap would refuse the cast of anyone
  // whose proficiency has outrun their rod in their OWN water, which is the
  // ordinary state of every angler mid-climb. What keeps them from overlapping
  // is that the zone gate already forces rodTier >= the zone's tier, so the
  // effective band can only fall short of the zone's own band through
  // PROFICIENCY. In other words the silent cap can only ever cost a player
  // who is over-rodded for where they stand, never one whose rod is illegal
  // for the water: that case was already refused, in words, before the cast.
