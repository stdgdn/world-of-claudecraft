// One shared cadence knob: state.md target of roughly 1 per zone per 20
// minutes, from 240s node respawn and 18 nodes per zone giving at most
// ~90 harvests per zone per 20 minutes; tuned per family. The derivation is
// the TUNED zones' (the R37 'complete' set): the v0.32.0 expansion's starter
// zones carry 6 nodes each, so their ceiling is ~30 harvests per 20 minutes
// and this knob lands them at roughly 1 event per zone per hour, an
// UN-TUNED cadence the zone-4 design pass owns per R37 (a per-zone knob or a
// starter-zone node count are both open there; do not split the constant
// here without that pass).
//
// Those two inputs both doubled at once (120s and up to 9 nodes before), and
// their product is what this knob reads, so the derivation lands on the same 90
// and the constant did not move. That is not a coincidence to preserve by luck:
// the node count and the respawn were changed together precisely to hold the
// per-zone harvest ceiling flat (see NODE_HARVEST_TABLE in gathering.ts). If
