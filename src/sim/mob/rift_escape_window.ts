// Rift boss escape windows (the mechanic-overlap follow-up to the shared
// spacing lock in ./mechanic_spacing.ts).
//
// The spacing lock spaces mechanic FIRES; the 2026-08-04 player feedback showed
// the remaining overlaps live in the layers the lock deliberately left alone:
// the free-running anti-kite snare (aoeSlow) could fire in the middle of a
// death-zone telegraph, the on-hit control procs (web root, knockback) could
// strip movement during one, and a death zone's fuse assumed an UNIMPAIRED
// runner (the RIFT_S_ZONE_TEMPO escape math is solved at player run speed 7,
// rift/ranks.ts), so a snared player could face a mathematically inescapable
// zone. This module is the shared definition of "the players are being asked
// to move RIGHT NOW" that those layers consult:
//
// - riftEscapeWindowActive: a telegraph is live on this boss. The window is an
//   ABSOLUTE sim-time deadline (escapeWindowUntil), stamped at every telegraph
//   start to the moment the last blast can land, never a castingAbility
//   introspection: a kited boss freezes its melee-gated cast bar, and a frozen
//   bar pinning the window open would permanently disable the very anti-kite
//   snare the exemption in mechanic_spacing.ts protects. While the window is
//   open, the snare holds at due (mob/locomotion.ts) and the on-hit control
//   procs still DRAW their rng roll (parity draw-order stability, the
//   mechanicDamageMult precedent) but skip their effect (mob/mob_swing.ts).
// - impairedZoneFuseMult: how much longer a death-zone fuse must run for THIS
//   anchor so their CURRENT movement impairment still leaves a real escape
//   window, capped so a permaslow cannot stretch a zone forever.
//
// Everything here is gated on the rift spawn stamp (riftMechanicSpacing, set
// only by rift/runs.ts): world, dungeon, and raid bosses never consult these
// and keep their shipped behavior. A SYSTEM MODULE behind the SimContext seam
// (it reads ctx.time/isRooted/moveSpeedMult), not a pure leaf; it draws no
// rng and touches no DOM, and a Vitest imports it directly.
