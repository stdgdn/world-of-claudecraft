// Unreachable-target detection for engaged mobs: the classic evade trigger.
// Mobs chase in a straight line with a slide fan and no pathfinding, so a mob
// whose target stands past a wall or under an unclimbable ledge pins in place
// forever, still in combat, while the target chips it down risk-free (the rift
// ledge exploit). This module watches for that shape: engaged, out of reach,
// committing zero movement, with the straight step toward the target refused
// by the same block modes moveToward enforces. After CHASE_STALL_TIMEOUT
// seconds of that, the caller (combat_profile.ts) sends the mob home through
// the existing evade state (immune, heals to full on arrival).
//
// This applies to EVERY canLeash mob, bosses included: pinning a boss out of
// reach force-resets the pull (full heal, loot rights dropped). That is the
// intended classic behavior, the whole point being that an unreachable
// attacker gets nothing; only canLeash false encounter scripts (Nythraxis)
// opt out.
//
// Draws NO rng and writes nothing but mob.chaseStall, so the parity goldens
// are unaffected: the accumulator stays 0 in every scenario where mobs fight
// in contact or make chase progress.
