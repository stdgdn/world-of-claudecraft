// Tab target cycling order.
//
// Classic-style Tab targeting should cycle the enemies a player can actually
// see and fight, not the nearest blip anywhere in radius. The sim has no
// camera (the same code runs on the authoritative server and headless), so
// "on screen" is modelled deterministically from the player's facing: the
// forward vector is (sin(facing), cos(facing)) (see player movement in
// sim.ts), and a target counts as on screen when it falls inside a FLARED front
// cone around that vector. The cone's half-angle grows with distance
// (tabConeHalfAt): tight up close so a mob right beside you is not "in front",
// widening farther out where a small screen offset still reads as ahead. "In
// combat with you" is supplied by the caller from sim aggro state. Candidates
// are ranked into priority tiers so engaged, on-screen
// enemies cycle first, while off-screen ones stay reachable as a last resort
// instead of stealing the selection. Ties break by distance then id, so the
// order is stable and replay-deterministic.
//
// On top of the tier order, candidates are split into two bands: a near "fight
// cluster" and a distant fallback. Visibility is the master gate: an enemy joins
// the cluster only when it is ON SCREEN and (engaged with the player OR within
// TAB_NEAR_RADIUS). Being engaged relaxes the distance (a mob fighting you in
// front at 35 yd still cycles) but never the facing, so an enemy off screen to
// the side or behind the player is always fallback even while it is attacking
// you. Everything not in the cluster (idle enemies past the radius, and any
// enemy off screen) is the fallback band. Tab cycles and WRAPS within the
// cluster, so a DoT class can dot the nearest few mobs it can see, Tab through
// them, then Tab once more to land back on the priority target, instead of
// stepping out to an idle mob two screens away or one off to the side
// (#tab-near-cluster). An enemy actively engaged in melee with the player also
// joins the cluster, even outside the facing cone, so an immediate attacker
// cannot lose target priority to a distant idle mob. Keeping the wider off-screen
// engaged band out of the cluster still means a warrior fleeing a fight can turn
// toward a fresh mob, Tab it, and Charge away, rather than Tab snapping back to
// the enemy chasing from behind. The fallback band is reached only when the
// cluster is empty (e.g. the player has turned away from every enemy), so Tab
// never leaves the player unable to target anything.
