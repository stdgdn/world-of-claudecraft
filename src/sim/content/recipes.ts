// Recipe content (issue #1127): common-tier crafting recipes, one or two per
// craft on the ring (src/sim/content/professions.ts CRAFT_RING). Data-as-code,
// exempt from module-first size rules per root CLAUDE.md (a declarative table,
// not logic): the resolution logic lives in ../professions/crafting.ts behind
// the SimContext seam.
//
// Scope: COMMON_RECIPES all carry skillReq 0 (the free floor: a common-tier
// recipe is craftable with zero craft skill, gated only by having the
// materials). The file has since grown past that floor: TOOL_RECIPES
// (skillReq 75/150, station-bound at the toolworks) and COMBO_RECIPES
// (skillReq 25, the #1132 dual-craft gate) sit alongside it. There is still
// no skillReq admission gate anywhere: crafting.ts reads skillReq only for
// skill-gain scaling, and itemLevelBudget feeds the #1301 gold sink.
//
// Inputs are existing junk-material item ids (src/sim/content/items.ts):
// bone_fragments, linen_scrap, spider_leg. Since Professions 2.0
// nodes grant real materials (NODE_MATERIAL_TABLE in
// src/sim/professions/gathering.ts) and these junk items drop only from
// mobs/corpses; the recipes still consume them. Outputs reuse
// existing low-tier BASE_ITEMS entries (src/sim/content/items.ts) rather than
// introducing new item ids, to avoid expanding the positional item-name arrays
// in src/ui/i18n.catalog/items.ts for this issue.
//
// COMBO_RECIPES (issue #1132): tier-1 recipes exclusive to one specific
// adjacent pair on the CRAFT_RING (src/sim/content/professions.ts
// adjacentCrafts). Each carries a `comboRequirement` naming both crafts and
// the minimum tier both must independently meet; crafting.ts denies the
// craft if either is unmet, regardless of skill in any other craft. Pairs
// used here were confirmed via adjacentCrafts: armorcrafting is adjacent to
// weaponcrafting (both Material pole), and alchemy is adjacent to
// engineering (both Experimental pole). Reagents reuse the same harvested
// materials as the common tier; outputs reuse existing BASE_ITEMS entries
// (boundstone_helm, gravewyrm_gauntlets, elixir_of_the_bear) for the same
// i18n reason as above.
//
// Acquisition (Professions 2.0, locked scope): ONLY the three
// COMBO_RECIPES carry `acquisition: ['trainer']`, learned from the resident
// master at their craft's station (professions/training.ts resolveTrain).
// COMMON_RECIPES, TOOL_RECIPES, and CASTER_HUB_RECIPES deliberately keep NO
// acquisition field: state.md locks them grandfathered, known to everyone via
// the empty-acquisition arm of crafting.ts isRecipeKnown. Existing characters
// keep the combo recipes too, via the one-time grandfather union
// (training.ts PRE_TRAINING_RECIPE_IDS / grandfatherKnownRecipes); every
// newly authored recipe must carry a non-empty acquisition list (see
// the field doc in ../professions/types.ts).

// skill gain (#1128's soft tier mastery: full at/above capability, reduced
// one tier under, zero two-plus under, and zero above the #1129 archetype
// ceiling), never as an admission gate: these are craftable on having the
// reagents and standing at the hub station, same as any common recipe.
//
// stationType (Professions 2.0, formerly #1297's requiresHubStation):
// every recipe below is station-bound at the toolworks (content/professions.ts
// STATIONS, checked by ../professions/stations.ts). These are the natural
// first station-bound recipes: real tier-4/5 gear already tier-gated well
// past the common free floor, unlike COMMON_RECIPES/COMBO_RECIPES above
// (both free-field-craftable, deliberately left ungated here).
//
// Every gathered reagent below is a FINE grade (D8,
// professions/material_grades.ts), which is what turns this list from a
// shopping list into a ladder: a fine material only drops for a player whose
// tool is already strictly above it, and each recipe also consumes the tool
// one rung down, so the rung below is the only route to the rung above. The
// counts and the previous-tool reagent are unchanged; only the grade moved.
//
// Two rungs needed a decision rather than a swap, and both are recorded here
// because the reagent lists alone do not show why they differ:
//
// - The tier-4 PICK could not simply take fine_thorium_ore. Osmium is the
//   thornpeak (tier-3) yield, so its fine grade needs a tier-4 pick, which is
//   this recipe's own output: a closed circuit with no entry. It is re-pointed
//   onto fine_iron_ore, the mirefen (tier-2) yield, whose fine grade needs the
//   tier-3 pick this recipe already consumes. That is exactly the shape the
//   axe and sickle lines already had, so all three tier-4 recipes now read the
//   same way instead of the pick being the odd one out.
// - The tier-5 PICK has no node material at all: arcanite_bar is refined and
//   vendor-only by locked ruling, and is consumed by nothing else, so
//   re-pointing off it would strand both the bar and its vendor rows. It KEEPS
//   the bar and GAINS fine_thorium_ore x2, matching the other two tier-5
//   recipes (two units of the thornpeak fine grade plus the tier-4 tool) and
//   giving fine_thorium_ore the consumer it would otherwise lack. It is the
//   one rung that got more expensive rather than equivalent; that is the
//   point, since it was the one rung still buyable off a counter.

// The crafted fishing rods, tier 4 and tier 5 (D9).
//
// A SEPARATE LIST FROM TOOL_RECIPES, deliberately. TOOL_RECIPES carries one
// invariant that is the whole reason it exists: every member consumes a FINE
// gathered grade plus the tool one rung down, which is what makes that ladder
// self-gating (the grade only drops for a player whose tool already outclasses
// it). Fishing has no world nodes, so it has no fine grades, and folding these
// two rows in would turn that invariant into "a fine grade OR a rare catch",
// a disjunction the six land recipes could then quietly stop satisfying while
// the sweep stayed green on the rods. A weaker shared claim is worth less than
// two strong separate ones, so the rod ladder states its own
// (tests/professions_rod_recipes.test.ts) and leaves TOOL_RECIPES alone.
//
// HOW FAR THE SELF-GATE ACTUALLY REACHES, stated plainly rather than implied.
// Each rung consumes the rod below it, same as the land ladder. The rest
// diverges:
//
// - The tier-4 rung is paced, not gated. Its reagent is the rare catch, whose
//   weight is 1 / 3 / 6 by proficiency band (content/items.ts), so a capped
//   angler farms it six times faster than a beginner. A beginner CAN still
//   land one, which is the deliberate difference from a fine grade: the koi
//   is also the low-level thrill and a deed target, and gating it behind
//   fishing's 200 cap would have put the tier-4 rod behind the end of the
//   climb rather than partway up it, which is not where the land tier-4 tools
//   sit.
// - The tier-5 rung IS hard-gated, and that is what the Slatefin Carp is
//   doing in it. Carp is a Thornpeak-only catch, and Thornpeak water takes a
//   tier-3 rod (professions/fishing_zones.ts), so the reagent cannot be
//   fished at all without the rung this recipe's own input descends from.
//
// Neither rung joins the counterfactually-vendor-fed set in
// tests/recipe_economy.test.ts, because the koi carries no buyValue and no
// counter stocks it. That is a property of the reagent, not an exemption.
//
// Both carry `acquisition: ['trainer']`: the pre-training recipe list is a
// frozen historical record and must not grow, so anything authored after that
// switch is learned from a master. Tinker Gizzel at the Eastbrook toolworks
// teaches them, without a content edit, because the trainer's list derives
// from the crafts its station serves.
//
// SKILL REQUIREMENTS ARE BOTH INSIDE ENGINEERING'S CAP (125), unlike the
// tier-5 land tools at 75/150. 150 resolves to tier 6 while the cap resolves
// to tier 5, and a trainer only teaches a recipe whose tier the learner has
// reached, so a trainer-taught recipe at 150 would be permanently unlearnable
// rather than merely expensive. The land tools escape that only because they
// predate training and are grandfathered known.

//
// - `professionId: 'enchanting'` is identity, not listing convenience: the

// - `acquisition: ['trainer']` per the authoring default (the pre-training
//   grandfather list is frozen); skillReq 25 resolves to tier 1, so learning
//   needs enchanting 25 (a real disenchant/enchant climb) and the tier-1
//   training fee.
// - REAGENTS ARE THE PRICE FLOOR, not flavor: re-slotting a fresh charm
//   resets charges to full, so the mint MUST cost more than the most
//   expensive generic recharge (a full epic-rung fill priced in shards) or
//   re-crafting would bypass recharging outright. The whole arcane ladder is
//   consumed (shards the bulk of the value), which also gives the shard its
//   second sink beside the Greater enchants. The counts clear the bound at

//   consumes floor(count x 0.8) of each reagent (crafting.ts
//   requiredReagentCountFor), which is the arm that actually competes with a
//   recharge, so the listed 383 copper is sized so the discounted 298 still
