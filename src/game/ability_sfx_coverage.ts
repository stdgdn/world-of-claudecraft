// Which per-ability audio moments a hand-recorded studio cue already carries.
//
// Two independent systems sound the same instant. The older one is the recorded
// cue pack: src/ui/combat_sfx.ts resolves a key per sim event and hud.ts plays
// it (proj_<school> at the caster when a spell launches, impact_<school> or a
// material impact where it lands, combat_crit on a crit, heal_impact,
// buff_apply). Those keys are Jamie's studio recordings, marked `custom: true`
// in scripts/sfx/sfx_prompts.mjs. The newer one is the ability-VFX engine's
// procedural layer (sfx.ts abilityAudio), which fires release/impact moments
// from src/render/ability_vfx/sequencer.ts for all 294 spec'd abilities.
//
// They were never reconciled, so a Fireball played the recording AND a
// synthetic whoosh + boom on top of it, at the same instant and position. The
// synth masked the recordings rather than replacing them. This module is the
// reconciliation: the procedural layer asks first, and stays silent wherever a
// recording already speaks. It keeps its voice only where no recording exists,
// which is what the VFX work genuinely adds.
//
// Pure and host-agnostic on purpose (no DOM, no AudioContext, no sim import):
// the caller resolves the ability's school and archetype and passes them in.
