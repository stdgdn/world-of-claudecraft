// onto a small profile the applier publishes to the page as `data-fx-level` plus
// the `--fx-*` tokens. Driven by the STATIC graphics preset only, never the FPS
// governor (the two-controller hazard: the auto-governor cannot measure compositor
// blur cost, so the HUD effect tier is owned by the preset the player chose).
//
// This module is host-agnostic and DOM/Three-free: it is registered with
// tests/architecture.test.ts and unit-tested directly under Node. It is a
// render-importable LEAF in src/game (not src/ui): src/render/gfx.ts imports
// EFFECTS_QUALITY_LOW_CUTOFF from here so the HUD effect tier and the 3D renderer
// agree on the same effectsQuality cutoff (one source of truth, no duplication),
// and render must never import ui. It imports NOTHING (no governor, no render, no
// ui), which is the heart of the two-controller-hazard acceptance.

 *
 * Precedence (unit-tested in tests/ui_effects_profile.test.ts):
 * - The tier is a FLOOR, not a ceiling: the preset sets the baseline effect level
 *   and nothing here raises it above the player's choice.
 * - For 'advanced', effectsQuality < EFFECTS_QUALITY_LOW_CUTOFF clamps to the low
 *   cost path (mirroring the renderer's own effectsQuality<cutoff downgrade);
 *   otherwise 'advanced' behaves as ultra. It is NOT collapsed to 'high': the expert
 *   path sheds HUD cost independently.
 * - Reduced-motion is the STRONGEST motion authority: it forces motion:'none' and
 *   pauses ambient loops, but it does NOT by itself drop glass (that is the tier's
 *   job, so an Ultra reduced-motion player keeps glass and only loses motion).
 * - Low tier cuts cost independent of motion: no heavy decorative shadows, no FCT
 *   crit emphasis, ambient paused. (Glass is dropped by the data-fx-level CSS at
 *   low; this profile carries the JS/token-driven cuts.)
