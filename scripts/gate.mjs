// The full local pre-merge gate: the CI checks from .github/workflows/ci.yml run
// locally. CI splits each tier into a parallel pair (PR: pr-gate + pr-checks;
// release: release-gate + release-checks) and fans each test job across an
// 8-shard matrix; this script runs the SAME combined step list serially with
// ONE full unsharded vitest run by design (no shard flag). The parallel lint
// job's changed-files biome is pulled forward as an early fast-fail; on a
// release/** branch the step list ADDS one dedicated release-tier step
// (I18N_RELEASE_TIER=1 over the suites that read it), mirroring the release-i18n
// job; the full suite stays at PR tier in both places so an outstanding locale
// fill can never mask a real test failure (#2820). This script exists because
// ad-hoc shell chains get the gate wrong in two known ways: piping `npm test`
// through `tail` masks vitest's exit code (a red run can print "PASS"), and an
// unbounded full run saturates every core and flakes the heavy sim suites when
// other work shares the machine (failing files that then pass in isolation).
// Steps run sequentially with inherited stdio and stop at the first failure.
// Keep the step list in sync with .github/workflows/ci.yml (and vice versa).
//
// Phase 2: generate-once i18n + wiki; vitest skips pretest; client uses
// build:bundle (no triple gen). Phase 8: pure artifact steps go through turbo
// (local disk cache + parallel typecheck/env/server). Tests, malware, and
// changed-file biome are never treated as cacheable "green forever".
