// The SELECTIVE gate (`node scripts/gate_select.mjs`).
//
// No npm alias: tests/fenbridge_town_assets.test.ts fingerprints the whole of
// package.json as an input to a shipping GLB, so adding a script entry
// invalidates that asset and demands a 63-file re-export. Not worth the churn in
// a tooling change; adding the alias is a follow-up.
//
// Positioning, because this repo has several gate paths and the difference
// between them is the whole point:
//
//   gate:fast   day loop ONLY. A high-signal subset that drops most of the
//               non-test steps, including every build and the admin/bot
//               typechecks, so a change breaking the client bundle or the admin
//               Svelte types passes it cleanly. Never a merge bar.
//
//   gate        the historical merge bar. Every step, plus one full unsharded
//               vitest over the whole suite. Provably complete, and its vitest
//               step alone dominates the run.
//
//   gate:select THIS FILE. The FULL gate's step list, plus the same preflights,
//               with exactly one substitution: the full vitest run becomes an
//               always-run leg plus a `vitest related` leg. Every non-test check
//               stays identical to `gate`, so build, typecheck, freshness, sfx,
//               malware and browser coverage are not reduced at all. Only the
//               test selection narrows, and only for changes the planner can
//               reason about.
//
// Why narrowing tests is safe enough to ship a PR on. `vitest related` selects on
// the STATIC IMPORT GRAPH and misses the rest SILENTLY (a skipped test does not
// error; the gate still prints PASS). So the graph is never trusted alone: every
// test file is classified first (lib/test_visibility.mjs) and the ones reaching
// outside the graph (disk scans, subprocesses, dynamic imports, fs-touching
// shared helpers) ALWAYS run. `related` covers only the graph-visible remainder.
// Any change the planner cannot classify drops the whole run to the full suite.
//
// What it still cannot prove. Selection is empirically complete, not provably
// complete: the out-of-graph pattern list is a floor. That is why this path is
// paired with a scheduled full run (see docs/qa-gate.md) which re-establishes a
// known-green baseline off everyone's critical path.
