# docs/: Design & PRD reference

**Reference material, not auto-loaded.** Open the relevant doc when working on that
feature. Two kinds live here: **living docs** (runbooks, specs for unbuilt work) and
**historical records** (shipped programs, one-off reports). Only living docs carry
source-of-truth weight, and even they describe *intended* behavior: when code and a doc
disagree, re-verify against code and note the deviation. PRD `file:line` hook points
drift as the tree moves: re-find the exact location, trust the doc's intent, not its
line numbers. A new doc lands in `design/` (how a system should work), `prd/` (a
feature spec), or its program's dir; the top level is only for a living runbook.

## Layout
`ls docs/` for the current set; the named rows carry rules or are load-bearing.
| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `design/` | How systems are/should be built (notes below). |
| `prd/` | Feature specs: requirements + `file:line` hook points + acceptance criteria. |
| `qa-gate.md` | The QA-gate reference (Stop hook, pre-push floor, `npm run gate`, `/qa`); root CLAUDE.md points here. Living. |
| `merge-queue.md` | The merge queue + required-check contract on `main` and `release/**` (the ruleset settings are not in git; this is their written contract, and the operator note for queue rejections). Living. |
| `image-to-glb-asset-workflow.md` | Living runbook for reference-image intake, procedural Three.js authoring, optimized GLB export, renderer integration, performance gates, and in-game visual proof. |
| `desktop-release.md`, `desktop-ship-notes.md`, `mobile-store-release.md` | Release runbooks (Electron/Steam; iOS/Android). Living. |
| `sfx-studio-tutorial.md`, `codex.md` | Operator guides: the SFX Studio; the Codex support layer. Living. |
| `security/` | `malware-scan-catalog.md`: the path-aware triage priors behind `scripts/malware_scan.mjs --gate`. `dependency-audit-catalog.md`: the `pnpm audit` gate model plus the accepted-advisory register `tests/dependency_audit_gate.test.ts` requires an entry in. Both living. |
| `i18n/` | Localized contributor docs: per-locale translations of the root `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` (see i18n note below). |
| `i18n-scaling/` | i18n architecture + workflow docs. `translation-workflow.md` is the canonical contributor/maintainer roles reference (root and `src/ui/CLAUDE.md` point here); `lazy-locales-and-contributor-workflow.md` is the lazy-locale/hygiene design package. |
| `achievements/` | Book of Deeds handoff: maintainer notes (open decisions, deferrals, follow-ups) and the deed icon art brief. |
| `release-notes/` | Per-version release notes. |
| `screenshots/` | README hero images, asset-pipeline evidence, and PR before/after shots (see below). |
| `api-pipeline/` | Server REST pipeline program packet (spec, progress, rollback runbook). |
| `architecture/`, `refactor/`, `hud-ux-and-accessibility/`, `ui-architecture-hud-modularization/` | Historical program records (the v0.15.0-era refactor doc, workstream hand-offs, completed phased UX/HUD programs): history, not source of truth. |
| other top-level `*.md` | One-off reports (`hud-program-roadmap.md`, `performance-feel-audit.md`, `online-movement-latency.md`, ...). |

## design/ & prd/ contents
`ls` the dirs for the current set; most filenames say what they are. The non-obvious
ones worth knowing: `design/master-spec.md` is the big design doc (levels 6 to 20
expansion: story arc, zones, dungeons, XP math, ids); `design/spell-ranks.md` is the
classic-era ability-rank reference for sim ability content; `design/deeds.md` is the
Book of Deeds achievements system plus the authoring contract every new deed (and
every new piece of conquerable content) follows. `design/design-language/` holds the
approved desktop reference renders (images only, no local doc) that the repo-root
`DESIGN.md` design-language spec names as its primary references and links by path,
so keep the filenames stable. **TRAP:**
`design/icon-system.md` proposes a multi-file `src/ui/icons/` module, but the shipped
code is the flat `src/ui/icons.ts`, so re-verify against code.
**Shipped history, same trap:** `design/ue5-overhaul-plan.md` is a completed program
(its output IS the current `public/` asset stack), and `prd/DELVE_REBUILD_V0.8.md` +
`prd/DELVE_HANDOFF.md` describe systems long since shipped (`src/sim/delve_layout.ts`,
`src/sim/content/delves/`, `src/sim/lockpick.ts`): read them as records, not plans.
`prd/frontier-pvp-honor.md` (Frostreach Frontier PvP zone, honor, $WOC stakes layer)
pairs with `prd/FRONTIER_PHASE1_HANDOFF.md`, a slice-by-slice implementation handoff
whose slices are specced but NOT yet implemented; read the handoff before starting one.

## screenshots/
JPG/PNG assets embedded by the repo-root `README.md` (title screen, zones, dungeons, UI),
asset-pipeline evidence (`eastbrook-vale-rebuild/`, `eastbrook-grand-armoury/`), living
design/PRD concepts (for example `wildheart/`), and visual-PR before/after shots.

Replacing a README hero: keep the same filename so README links do not break. Visual PRs
still commit before/after screenshots here and reference them from the PR body; generate
them with `scripts/pr_screenshots.mjs` (root workflow rule and the `pr-screenshots` skill).

Merged PR evidence is not load-bearing forever. Periodically purge dead before/after
directories that nothing in tests, README, CREDITS, or asset fingerprints still needs.
Do not delete `eastbrook-vale-rebuild/`, `eastbrook-grand-armoury/`, README heroes, or
other paths pinned by tests or provenance.

## i18n note (the only player/contributor-facing strings under `docs/`)
The doc *prose* here is dev/design reference, English-only. The exception is `i18n/`:
`README.<lang>.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.<lang>.md` are **hand-maintained localized mirrors**
(not generated) of the English root `README.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md`, linked from each
doc's language switcher, one per translated locale (the near-English `en_CA` overlay gets
no separate doc). Same split as the app: a contributor edits the **English source** only;
the maintainer fills every locale mirror at release. Don't hand-translate or stub these in
a PR. (`docs/i18n-scaling/worklist/` is a gitignored generated artifact, never edit;
`npm run i18n:worklist` regenerates it.)
