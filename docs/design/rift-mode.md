# Rift Mode architecture

Rift Mode is a shared overworld race whose dungeon runtime remains isolated per
group. A natural portal owns one `RiftEvent`; each solo player or party entering
that event owns a separate `RiftInstance`. Instances share only the immutable
content artifact and the event's atomic first-clear claim.

## Runtime flow

1. `rift/portals.ts` keeps one deterministic C/B/A/S portal open in EVERY
   eligible new-world zone, cycling hourly (a zone's next portal opens one
   cycle after the previous one opened).
2. The existing procedural generator creates the draft and remains authoritative
   for layouts, colliders, mechanics, and safe spawn points.
3. `rift/upgrader_draft.ts` immediately builds a validated heuristic upgrade. The
   live realm may replace it with an AI result before anybody enters.
4. Entry freezes the artifact (`contentLocked`) and allocates one independent
   instance per group. Every competing instance receives the same artifact hash.
5. `rift/race.ts` performs the single-threaded check-and-write first-clear claim.
   The winner receives the race rewards; every other instance keeps running and
   completes as the race loser when its own boss falls, with an egress but NO
   completion loot (no gear ladder, no sealed cache, no first-clear extras): a
   loser keeps only what dropped off the mobs. The first mob kill marks an
   instance PROGRESSED, which binds its members to it WoW-raid style; unspoiled
   instances recycle when their members regroup, so a freshly formed party
   shares one clean run.
6. `rift/persistence.ts` saves portal deadlines, event history, winner metadata,
   scheduler state, and upgrade artifacts. Runtime party instances are never
   restored after a realm restart.

## AI Dungeon Upgrader

The server integration is optional and disabled unless configured. Model output
is untrusted data: `rift/upgrade.ts` rebuilds a bounded manifest and rejects unknown
themes, invented monster IDs, incompatible rosters/bosses, arbitrary stats,
executable content, excessive prose, and excess asset requests. Invalid, timed-out,
over-budget, or late responses leave the deterministic heuristic artifact in use.

The dedicated-service configuration is:

- `RIFT_UPGRADER_URL`
- `RIFT_UPGRADER_API_KEY` (optional when the service uses network identity)
- `RIFT_UPGRADER_TIMEOUT_MS` (2-60 seconds, default 20 seconds)
- `RIFT_UPGRADER_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_HOUR` (1-24, default 4)

Direct OpenAI Responses API mode is selected only when both are present:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `RIFT_UPGRADER_MODEL`

`RIFT_UPGRADER_OPENAI_URL` may override the official Responses endpoint. Secrets
remain server-side and are never emitted, persisted in Rift state, or sent to a
client.

## Rank difficulty

Rank (C/B/A/S) is the ONLY difficulty axis: a rift never scales with party size,
and mob levels are capped at 22 (23 at S), so all four ranks differ purely
through the spawn-time stat transform in `rift/ranks.ts`, the rank mechanic
budget (C=1 .. S=4 of a boss's `rankMechanics` kit), and the hazard gate.
Rifts are group content at every rank including C.

The ladder is calibrated onto the v0.30 dungeon ladder: C is a normal dungeon
(normal Gravewyrm Sanctum's own line), B is the heroic five-man line at 1.0x, A
is 1.2x heroic, S is 1.33x heroic. Health and damage are split by mob class
(spawn-list trash, boss, boss-summoned add), because one multiplier per rank
cannot serve two classes at once. The full derivation, the Monte Carlo benches,
the decision ledger, and pre-measured fallback options are in
[../rift-rank-monte-carlo-analysis.md](../rift-rank-monte-carlo-analysis.md);
every tuning literal and floor is pinned by
`tests/rift_difficulty_floors.test.ts`. Re-run the benches with
`npm run sim:rift`.

Note that only SPAWN-LIST templates (`RIFT_TRASH_IDS`) may be substituted into a
floor roster by an upgrade manifest. The shared summoned-add templates are
non-boss and appear in the bone, void and citadel theme rosters, but they are
non-elite and carry no loot table, so `applyRiftUpgrade` filters them out.

## Monster and asset safety

`content/rift/monster_index.ts` indexes every static Rift `MobTemplate` by role,
rarity, family, mechanics, lore, theme, biome, and stat profile. The upgrader may
compose encounters from this index, but combat always resolves through static
templates in `MOBS`.

Runtime asset generation is separately opt-in:

- `RIFT_RUNTIME_ASSETS=1`
- `RIFT_ASSET_PIPELINE_URL`
- `RIFT_ASSET_PIPELINE_API_KEY` (optional)
- `RIFT_ASSET_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `RIFT_ASSET_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_EVENT` (1-2, default 1)

The bridge submits bounded GLB jobs and records only an opaque job ID. A generated
binary is not hot-loaded into a live race. It must first pass QA and be promoted to
the immutable asset manifest, preserving graphics fairness, cacheability, and the
rule that no untrusted remote URL enters entity wire data.

## Progression

First-clear loot includes class-appropriate non-fungible Rift gear, Rift Essence,
and rank-dependent gems. Item payloads track source event, tier, power, upgrades,
enchantment, sockets, and gems. Their rolled stats apply while equipped, survive
save/load and wire round-trips, and are rebuilt from bounded inputs at load rather
than trusted from JSONB. Gear can be upgraded, enchanted, socketed, unequipped
without losing its payload, or salvaged back into power-scaled Rift Essence.

The forge (upgrade, enchant, socket) has no shipped client UI yet, so the
authoritative server refuses its three wire commands unless the realm opts in
with RIFT_FORGE_ENABLED=1 (server/rift_forge_gate.ts, pinned by
tests/rift_forge_gate.test.ts). Absent UI is not a gate: a crafted frame
reaches the wire regardless, and players used exactly that path for premature
progression before the gate landed. The sim methods stay live offline and in
tests; only the online dispatch arms are closed. Each refused attempt books
the woc_rift_forge_refused_total counter, the ops signal that probing
continues (or that a realm forgot the flag once the UI ships).

Note for whoever ships the forge UI: send the three commands through
ClientWorld's cmdWithOutcome (not the fire-and-forget cmd sender), because a
realm with the flag still off refuses with only a commandOutcome ok:false
ack, and a rid-less sender would surface that as pure silence to the player.
