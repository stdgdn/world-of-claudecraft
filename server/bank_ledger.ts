// Bank ledger: an OBSERVER of the sim's bank ops, never an authority. The sim bank
// methods (bankDeposit / bankWithdraw / bankBuySlots) return void and emit no
// success event by design (the ledger stays server-only, src/sim untouched), so the dispatch
// site detects success by diffing the public read Sim.bankInfoFor(pid) BEFORE and
// AFTER each call. A successful deposit/withdraw always changes the bank slot
// multiset; a successful buy_slots always increases purchasedSlots (its price is
// exactly the BEFORE snapshot's nextExpansionCost); a refused/no-op call changes
// nothing, so an empty diff writes no row. bankInfoFor returns null away from a
// banker, so a null on either side is also a no-op.

// anything, and the observer can never throw into the caller. A character lives on
