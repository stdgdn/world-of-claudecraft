 * GET /internal/discord/outbox -> everything the bot has to pick up, in ONE poll.
 *
 * The bot used to poll four endpoints on their own timers (relay, activity,
 * daily-rewards-winners, and a full re-read of every online member to notice
 * flex changes). This answers all of them together, so the bot's steady-state
 * cost is one request per interval rather than four plus a sweep. Those three
 * per-endpoint GET pickups are now RETIRED from both dispatch arms (#2791):
 * this poll is the only pickup surface.
 *
 * RouteDef-ONLY by design, like flex-batch: a route born after the pipeline
 * migration never gets a legacy handleDiscordInternal arm (server/http/CLAUDE.md),
 * so there is nothing to keep in lockstep here.
 *
 * ORDER OF WORK, and it is deliberate:
 *  1. Read the winner days FIRST, before anything is drained. It depends on
 *     nothing the drains produce, and it is the most failure-prone await here (a
 *     database read behind a TTL cache). Precisely: a COLD or just-busted winners
 *     cache whose refresh fails refuses the poll before a single queued item is
 *     consumed, while a WARM cache stale-serves through a refresh failure
 *     (createCachedRead's deliberate resilience). Stale-serve is safe here: it
 *     can only re-serve an UNMARKED day, which the retry contract below already
 *     delivers at-least-once, and a marked day can never be stale-served because
 *     markDiscordWinnersAnnounced busts the cache on success.
 *  2. Drain the three in-memory feeds. They are pure array splices, so a poll
 *     that finds nothing queued costs zero further Postgres round trips.
 *  3. Collect the account ids every drained item mentions. An EMPTY set issues no
 *     identity query at all.
 *  4. Otherwise resolve the whole union with ONE discordLinksForAccounts call.
 *     The per-item discordForAccount lookup the retired relay GET ran once per
 *     item never appears here: that N+1 is what invariant D1 forbids on this
 *     path.
 *
 * RETRY CONTRACT (Phase 6's retry logic is written against this):
 *  - `winners` is an IDEMPOTENT READ. It stays unannounced until the bot calls
 *    the mark endpoint, so it is delivered at-least-once across retries and a
 *    repeated poll simply re-reads the same days.
 *  - The three in-memory streams are PRESERVED ON ERROR and CONSUMED ON SUCCESS.
 *    Everything from the identity read to the response build runs inside a try
 *    whose catch requeues all three drains at the front of their queues, in
 *    order, before rethrowing. So a failed poll answers 500 with nothing lost and
 *    the next poll carries the same items; a 200 is the only outcome that
 *    consumes them, which is exactly what makes a bot-side retry safe.
 *  - A 200 response is therefore the ONLY acknowledgement. A bot that drops a
 *    successful response on the floor loses those items to its own next full
 *    resync, not to this endpoint.
 *
 * The envelope field order is relay, activity, winners, linkChanges, and each
 * stream keeps its queue's FIFO order. The relay and activity streams keep the
 * item shapes their retired per-endpoint GETs served (invariant D11, now this
 * poll's own contract with the bot); the winners stream dropped the fields
 * announcing never used when the standalone GET's byte-parity pin retired with
 * it (#2791); linkChanges was born here.

// ── Route table ────────────────────────────
// Every live handleInternalApi endpoint as a RouteDef for the shared dispatcher,
// plus flex-batch and outbox, which are RouteDef-ONLY (born after the migration,
// so they have no legacy ladder arm by design and nothing below to keep in
// lockstep): the deploy-gated restart-countdown plus the Discord-bot-gated
// routes (flaired-ids was added after the migration on BOTH arms per the
// dual-edit rule). The three per-endpoint GET pickups the outbox replaced
// (relay, activity, daily-rewards-winners) were RETIRED from BOTH arms in the
// same change (#2791), so both dispatch modes answer their legacy terminal 404.
// PARITY-FIRST: each thin handler REPRODUCES its frozen
// legacy branch above byte-for-byte (same imported data cores, same clamps and
// truncations, same ok()/fail() envelope bodies), and the secret gates move to
// the requireInternalSecret middleware, which writes the SAME legacy bodies
// (feature-off 404 'unknown endpoint', mismatch 401 'not authenticated'). The
// legacy handleInternalApi ladder stays intact as the flag-off rollback path
// (and as the dispatcher's delegate for unknown paths, wrong methods, and
// HEAD, which therefore keep the legacy 404 'unknown endpoint' behavior: the
// wrong-method restart-countdown stays 404, never the table router's 405).
//
// The separate /internal/daily-rewards/* ops family (handleDailyRewardInternalApi,
// server/daily_rewards.ts) was never part of this ladder and stays entirely on
// the delegate, unchanged.
//
// The one divergence is an UNEXPECTED handler/DB throw
// (internalBodyValidationRemap, tests/server/http/known_deviations.ts): the
// legacy ladder has NO outer catch (a throw becomes an unhandled rejection in
// main.ts's fire-and-forget arm and the request hangs), while the new path's
// withErrors serializes it through the admin-shape serializer as 500
// { success: false, data: null, error: 'internal.error' }. The internal
// envelope IS the admin { success, data, error } shape, so the routes carry
// meta.envelope 'admin' (EnvelopeKind is a frozen server/http/types.ts contract
// with no separate 'internal' member; serializeAdmin already emits this exact shape).

// The game-loop side effect the restart-countdown handler needs, injected at
// boot by main.ts (configureInternalRuntime(game)) so this module never
// imports the live GameServer instance.
