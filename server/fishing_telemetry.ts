// Fishing telemetry vocabulary: the bounded label sets the /metrics exporter
// uses for the fishing arc (casts, catches, koi, got-aways, empty hooks) and
// for the rod training fees, plus the pure classifiers that produce them. Kept
// out of game.ts and out of the exporter, exactly like server/economy_telemetry.ts,
// so all of it unit-tests with no registry, no socket, and no running world.
//
// Why these signals exist: fishing is the one gathering profession with no node
// to stand on, so nothing about it is visible from the harvest series. Three
// open questions need it. R4 asked whether the koi odds are right, which is a
// koi-per-catch rate per band. R8 asked what the rod training fees actually
// take out of the economy, which is a payment count per rod recipe times a
// static fee. And the empty-hook rate (the table's itemId:null row) is the
// difference between "fishing is slow" and "fishing is broken" and cannot be
// derived from a catch count alone. Casts are the denominator: casts minus
// catches minus empty hooks minus got-aways minus early reels is the
// sessions still in flight PLUS every session that ended without an outcome
// event (cancelled by a hit, a teleport, or the angler's own movement, plus
// the once-ever codfather quest catch, which returns before any outcome
// event), so the residual grows in steady state and is a cancellation
// gauge, never a zero-check. The early reel (a pre-bite re-press, the
// anti-spam arm) has its OWN outcome event and series rather than joining
// that residual or the got-aways: it is self-inflicted where a got-away is
// the game costing the player, and its rate is how to tell whether the
// spam fix burns legitimate anglers. One accepted band edge, unlike the zone (which the session
// pins on fishCastZoneId): the cast samples the effective band at cast time
// while the outcome events re-resolve it at completion, so a mid-session
// rod change (discarding the rod during the bite wait has no casting guard)
// can put a cast and its catch in different band cells. Per-band totals
// absorb it as residual noise; it cannot mint an off-vocabulary series.
//
// THE ZONE VOCABULARY IS HARVEST_BANDS, deliberately reused rather than
// re-derived: a fishing zone and a harvest zone are the same ZoneDef list, and
// a second copy would drift the moment a fourth zone ships.
//
// EVERY VOCABULARY HERE READS BUILTIN CONTENT (the src/sim/content modules,
// the same direction server/economy_telemetry.ts takes with src/sim/data), NOT
// the swappable active bundle that zoneAt now resolves through. That is a
// deliberate exception to the unify-the-content-reads sweep, not an oversight:
// a custom map's zone ids must never mint label series, so an event carrying
// one is DROPPED by the exporter's membership guard rather than counted.
// Nothing is lost in production, because only the client and the world editor
// ever call setActiveWorldContent; the authoritative server runs BUILTIN_WORLD,
// so every zone the sim can put on a fishing event is a member of this list.
//
// CARDINALITY IS BOUNDED BY CONSTRUCTION, the same contract as
// server/http/game_signals.ts: zones x bands is 3 x 3 per fishing family and
// the rod-fee family is the two shipped rod recipes. Nothing per-player
// (account id, character id, name, ip) is ever a label, and the exporter's
// membership guards drop anything off these lists rather than minting a series
// for it.
