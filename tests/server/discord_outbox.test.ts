// The size of what GET /internal/discord/outbox can hand back in one response,
// measured rather than argued.
//
// Consolidating four bot polls into one means one response now carries what four
// used to, and every stream feeding it is bounded for exactly that reason. This
// file drives the endpoint at the worst case those bounds admit (relay 50,
// activity 100, link changes OUTBOX_LINK_CHANGE_PAGE, one reward day with a full
// ten-payout table) and asserts the serialized payload stays under a stated byte
// bound. A page or cap raised without checking what it does to the response size
// fails here. Note the link-change bound is the PAGE, not the feed's cap: what a
// backlog past the page costs is another poll, not a bigger response, which is
// the paging case below.
//
// It lives beside tests/server/internal.test.ts rather than inside it because the
// fixtures are bulky and the question is different: that file pins the endpoint's
// BEHAVIOR (one identity read, the item shapes, the gates), this one pins its
// SIZE and the overflow rule of the feed that ships with it.
//
// Same rig as internal.test.ts: hoisted module mocks, then the real route chain
// (compose + withErrors + the real gate middleware) over a fakeCtx. The
// link-change feed module is deliberately NOT mocked, so its real cap and its
// real drain are what run.
