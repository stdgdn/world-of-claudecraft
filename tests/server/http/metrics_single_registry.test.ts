// The production registration shape (server/main.ts startServer): the HTTP
// exporter, the game-state family, and the business family all register onto
// the ONE prom-client Registry, one process per realm (single-exporter
// registration, phase 15 of the professions packet). startServer never runs
// under Vitest, so before this file a duplicate metric name across families
// (or a registrar run twice against the shared registry) would throw at BOOT
// with no test catching it. This performs the same registrations against one
// registry and scrapes it once. Default process metrics stay off to keep the
// test hermetic; their nodejs_*/process_* namespace cannot collide with the
// woc_*/http_* names asserted here.
