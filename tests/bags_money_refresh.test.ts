// Bag money-row freshness on a MONEY-ONLY change (issue #2373: collecting
// auction proceeds at the Merchant left the gold in the bag window stale until
// the player closed and reopened it).
//
// The defect is a missing convergence edge, not a missing button handler:
//  - the sim's proceeds arm moves ONLY meta.copper (src/sim/market.ts), so the
//    player's inventory is byte-identical;
//  - `copper` rides every self-frame in the server's UNCONDITIONAL base object
//    while `inv` is serialize-diffed, so a money-only frame carries no `inv`;
//  - ClientWorld therefore mirrored the new copper while raising NO
//    inventory-changed flag, and Hud.onInventoryChanged() (the one authoritative
//    online path to renderBags) never ran.
// The bag money row is a cold painter with no signature of its own, so nothing
// else converged it. That is the whole bug, and it is the same hole behind the
// trainer fee, the bank slot buy, and a settled Vale Cup bet.
//
// This file owns the WIRE half, driven through a REAL GameServer and a real
// ClientWorld: a proceeds-only collect must raise the flag from the copper delta
// alone (red before the fix), an unchanged purse must not raise it (which is what
// forces a diff rather than an `s.copper !== undefined` presence test, and with it a
// 20 Hz repaint), the pre-existing inventory arm must still flag, and the spectate
// anchor ruling is pinned so it cannot drift silently.
//
// The other two halves live where they can be EXECUTED rather than pattern-matched:
// the pure staleness decision is a truth table on bagsMoneyRowStale in
// tests/bags_view.test.ts, and the painter (including everything the refresh must
// not disturb) is driven against the real BagsWindow in
// tests/bags_money_row_paint.test.ts. Only the call-site wiring is pinned as source
// text here, and only where a unit test genuinely cannot reach.
