// The programmatic border waters (the Hollow's moats, the column straits, the
// row meres) are carved and rendered as water where two maps meet, and the
// design comments call them swimmable: the sim must agree. Field report: a
// player crossing from Palmreach into the Hollow at the west moat could not
// return (the "water" was mechanically dry land, so the movement kernel gated
// on the raw trench bed), and could not climb out under the border ridge that
// rose sheer from the channel.
//
// The fix: isInWaterBody covers the border-water rects (so swimming, the
// ride-height clamp, and the shore step-out all work there), the non-sealed
// border ridges gate out across those waters, and their banks get the same
// shore grading as declared lakes.
