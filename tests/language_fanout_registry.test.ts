// THE LANGUAGE FAN-OUT REGISTRY (#2529).
//
// A runtime language change does not reload the page. `changeLanguage`
// (src/main.ts) re-localizes the static shell and then dispatches
// `woc:languagechange`; `Hud.refreshLocalizedDynamicUi()` is the ONE hand-
// maintained fan-out that repaints the dynamic surfaces, and a surface is
// re-localized only if it appears in that method.
//
// WHY A SURFACE NEEDS TO BE IN IT. Two different elision idioms live in
// `src/ui`, and only one of them is locale-safe:
//   - a WRITE-ELISION facet (`PainterHostWriters`) compares the RESOLVED string
//     it is about to write, so a locale change moves the comparison and the
//     write happens by itself. Nothing to do.
//   - a REPAINT SIGNATURE (`lastSig` and its family) compares a digest of the
//     DATA: ids, counts, positions, booleans. Every one of those is
//     text-independent by design, which is the whole point of the idiom, and it
//     means `setLanguage` alone can never move one. A surface gated that way
//     keeps the previous locale until its data happens to change.
// Four windows had gone missing from the fan-out that way (calendar, mailbox,
// social, card duel), and nothing enumerated the list, which is why they could
// go missing quietly. Sweeping for the second idiom found five more, including
// one, the delve tracker, whose fan-out arm was PRESENT and inert: the arm
// called `update()`, and `update()` early-returned on its own unchanged
// signature.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE HOLDS, in two halves that fail for different reasons:
//   1. The fan-out's own call list, read off the AST and diffed BOTH WAYS
//      against `FANOUT_ARMS`. A new arm fails until it is registered; a deleted
//      arm fails until its row goes; a re-gated one fails because the gate text
//      is part of the key.
//   2. A sweep of `src/ui` for the signature idiom. Every module it finds must
//      be either answered by a named arm from half 1 or carry a written
//      exemption, and each one pins the memo fields it was classified on, so a
//      NEW memo added to an already-classified module re-opens the question
//      instead of inheriting an answer that was given about a different field.
//
// WHERE ITS TEETH STOP, stated rather than implied:
//   - The sweep recognizes the `x === this.lastFoo` comparison shape. A gate
//     written as a predicate call over retained state is invisible to it: the
//     tutorial overlay's `tutorialNeedsRerender(this.step, next, ...)` is the
//     live example, and it is covered instead by half 1 pinning its arm and by
//     the behavioral test in `language_fanout_relocalize.test.ts`.
//   - Half 1 sees `refreshLocalizedDynamicUi()`'s OWN body. An arm that calls a
//     `Hud` method which then fails to repaint is invisible here; the delve
//     tracker was exactly that, and what catches it is the behavioral arm, not
//     a call list.
//   - Neither half says anything about a COLD window (rendered on open, no
//     repaint driver at all). That is a different gap with a different answer
//     and it is not what #2529 is about.
//   - Half 1 registers STATEMENT-position calls. An arm added inside a callback
//     (`queueMicrotask(() => this.foo.relocalize())`) is invisible to it, though
//     deleting a registered arm is still caught.
//   - The memo sweep requires the literal `private` modifier and a `this.`
//     receiver, so a module-scoped `let lastSig` or a `#lastSig` would escape
//     it. There is no such module in `src/ui` today; if one lands, widen
//     MEMO_DECL rather than exempting the file.
//   - The sweep covers `src/ui` only. A signature-gated text surface under
//     `src/render/` would have to be caught in review.
