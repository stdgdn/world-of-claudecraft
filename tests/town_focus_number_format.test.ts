// Town Focus spells its numbers in the active locale (issue #2530).
//
// The panel handed three raw numbers straight to the render sinks: two as t()
// interpolation values for the budget line and one spliced into the row
// template's innerHTML. t()'s interpolate() finishes with a bare String(value),
// so none of the three ever reached Intl, two lines below a tier hint that
// formats correctly. Root CLAUDE.md: "Numbers, money, dates, percents go
// through formatNumber/formatMoney/formatDateTime/Intl."
//
// WHAT THIS FILE OWNS, stated narrowly on purpose: the three numbers the
// painter takes off the TownFocusView. The panel paints a FOURTH, the tier
// hint's POINTS_PER_TIER_BONUS / MAX_FOCUS_TIER_BONUS, which was already
// formatted and is the reference this fix was written to match. It is not
// pinned here or anywhere else, and it cannot be pinned the way these three
// are: both are module constants imported from src/sim/professions/focus (5 and
// 2), so no input reaches the range where a formatted and a raw number differ
// and both arms of any assertion would coincide.
//
// WHY THIS FILE HAS TO BUILD AN OUT-OF-RANGE VIEW, stated up front because it
// is the one thing a reader will question. FOCUS_POINT_BUDGET is 10, and every
// supported locale renders 0..999 as the same ASCII digits (none uses a
// non-Latin numbering system, and no grouping separator fires below a
// thousand). So a case painted at the shipped budget cannot tell a formatted
// number from a raw one: both arms of the fix coincide and the pin is dead on
// arrival. Every view below still comes out of the REAL buildTownFocusView,
// which takes the budget as a parameter and reads points straight off the
// allocation, so what is synthetic is the INPUT, never the view shape.
//
// The third case is the same argument one level down: { maximumFractionDigits: 0 }
// is unobservable on any integer, so a fractional input is the only way to
// assert the option bag behaviorally instead of scraping the painter's source
// for the literal call (which a local helper would silently kill).
//
// The repaint gate (tests/town_focus_repaint_gate.test.ts) owns everything else
// about this painter and asserts nothing about rendered digits, deliberately:
// it queries controls by data-focus-key and by class, so formatting is free to
// change under it.
